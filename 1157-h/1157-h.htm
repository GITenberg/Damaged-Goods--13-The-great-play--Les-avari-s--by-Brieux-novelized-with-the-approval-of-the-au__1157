      PREFACE
    </h2>
    <p>
      My endeavor has been to tell a simple story, preserving as closely as
      possible the spirit and feeling of the original. I have tried, as it were,
      to take the play to pieces, and build a novel out of the same material. I
      have not felt at liberty to embellish M. Brieux's ideas, and I have used
      his dialogue word for word wherever possible. Unless I have mis-read the
      author, his sole purpose in writing LES AVARIES was to place a number of
      most important facts before the minds of the public, and to drive them
      home by means of intense emotion. If I have been able to assist him, this
      bit of literary carpentering will be worth while. I have to thank M.
      Brieux for his kind permission to make the attempt, and for the cordial
      spirit which he has manifested.

      PRESS COMMENTS ON THE PLAY
    </h2>
    <p>
      DAMAGED GOODS was first presented in America at a Friday matinee on March
      14th, 1913, in the Fulton Theater, New York, before members of the
      Sociological Fund. Immediately it was acclaimed by public press and pulpit
      as the greatest contribution ever made by the Stage to the cause of
      humanity. Mr. Richard Bennett, the producer, who had the courage to
      present the play, with the aid of his co-workers, in the face of most
      savage criticism from the ignorant, was overwhelmed with requests for a
      repetition of the performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before deciding whether of not to present DAMAGED GOODS before the general
      public, it was arranged that the highest officials in the United States
      should pass judgment upon the manner in which the play teaches its vital
      lesson. A special guest performance for members of the Cabinet, members of
      both houses of Congress, members of the United States Supreme Court,
      representatives of the Diplomatic corps and others prominent in national
      life was given in Washington, D.C.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the performance was given on a Sunday afternoon (April 6, 1913),
      the National Theater was crowded to the very doors with the most
      distinguished audience ever assembled in America, including exclusively
      the foremost men and women of the Capital. The most noted clergymen of
      Washington were among the spectators.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of this remarkable performance was a tremendous endorsement of
      the play and of the manner in which Mr. Bennett and his co-workers were
      presenting it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This reception resulted in the continuance of the New York performances
      until mid-summer and is responsible for the decision on the part of Mr.
      Bennett to offer the play in every city in America where citizens feel
      that the ultimate welfare of the community is dependent upon a higher
      standard of morality and clearer understanding of the laws of health.
    </p>
    <p>
      The WASHINGTON POST, commenting on the Washington performance, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      The play was presented with all the impressiveness of a sermon; with all
      the vigor and dynamic force of a great drama; with all the earnestness and
      power of a vital truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      In many respects the presentation of this dramatization of a great social
      evil assumed the aspects of a religious service. Dr. Donald C. Macleod,
      pastor of the First Presbyterian Church, mounted the rostrum usually
      occupied by the leader of the orchestra, and announced that the nature of
      the performance, the sacredness of the play, and the character of the
      audience gave to the play the significance of a tremendous sermon in
      behalf of mankind, and that as such it was eminently fitting that a divine
      blessing be invoked. Dr. Earle Wilfley, pastor of the Vermont Avenue
      Christian Church, asked all persons in the audience to bow their heads in
      a prayer for the proper reception of the message to be presented from the
      stage. Dr. MacLeod then read the Bernard Shaw preface to the play, and
      asked that there be no applause during the performance, a suggestion which
      was rigidly followed, thus adding greatly to the effectiveness and the
      seriousness of the dramatic portrayal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The impression made upon the audience by the remarkable play is reflected
      in such comments as the following expressions voiced after the
      performance:
    </p>
    <p>
      RABBI SIMON, OF THE WASHINGTON HEBREW CONGREGATION&mdash;If I could preach
      from my pulpit a sermon one tenth as powerful, as convincing, as
      far-reaching, and as helpful as this performance of DAMAGED GOODS must be,
      I would consider that I had achieved the triumph of my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      COMMISSIONER CUNO H. RUDOLPH&mdash;I was deeply impressed by what I saw,
      and I think that the drama should be repeated in every city, a matinee one
      day for father and son and the next day for mother and daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      REV. EARLE WILFLEY&mdash;I am confirmed in the opinion that we must take
      up our cudgels in a crusade against the modern problems brought to the
      fore by DAMAGED GOODS. The report that these diseases are increasing is
      enough to make us get busy on a campaign against them.
    </p>
    <p>
      SURGEON GENERAL BLUE&mdash;It was a most striking and telling lesson. For
      years we have been fighting these condition in the navy. It is high time
      that civilians awakened to the dangers surrounding them and crusaded
      against them in a proper manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ARCHIBALD HOPKINS&mdash;The play was a powerful presentation of a
      very important question and was handled in a most admirable manner. The
      drama is a fine entering wedge for this crusade and is bound to do
      considerable good in conveying information of a very serious nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      MINISTER PEZET, OF PERU&mdash;There can be no doubt but that the
      performance will have great uplifting power, and accomplish the good for
      which it was created. Fortunately, we do not have the prudery in South
      America that you of the north possess, and have open minds to consider
      these serious questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      JUSTICE DANIEL THEW WRIGHT&mdash;I feel quite sure that DAMAGED GOODS will
      have considerable effect in educating the people of the nature of the
      danger that surrounds them.
    </p>
    <p>
      SENATOR KERN, OF INDIANA&mdash;There can be no denial of the fact that it
      is time to look at the serious problems presented in the play with an open
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brieux has been hailed by Bernard Shaw as "incomparably the greatest
      writer France has produced since Moliere," and perhaps no writer ever
      wielded his pen more earnestly in the service of the race. To quote from
      an article by Edwin E. Slosson in the INDEPENDENT:
    </p>
    <p>
      Brieux is not one who believes that social evils are to be cured by laws
      and yet more laws. He believes that most of the trouble is caused by
      ignorance and urges education, public enlightenment and franker
      recognition of existing conditions. All this may be needed, but still we
      may well doubt its effectiveness as a remedy. The drunken Helot argument
      is not a strong one, and those who lead a vicious life know more about its
      risks than any teacher or preacher could tell them. Brieux also urges the
      requirement of health certificates for marriage, such as many clergymen
      now insist upon and which doubtless will be made compulsory before long in
      many of our States.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brieux paints in black colors yet is no fanatic; in fact, he will be
      criticised by many as being too tolerant of human weakness. The conditions
      of society and the moral standards of France are so different from those
      of America that his point of view and his proposals for reform will not
      meet with general acceptance, but it is encouraging to find a dramatist
      who realizes the importance of being earnest and who uses his art in
      defense of virtue instead of its destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other comments follow, showing the great interest manifested in the play
      and the belief in the highest seriousness of its purpose:
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no uncleanness in facts. The uncleanness is in the glamour, in
      the secret imagination. It is in hints, half-truths, and suggestions the
      threat to life lies.
    </p>
    <p>
      This play puts the horrible truth in so living a way, with such clean,
      artistic force, that the mind is impressed as it could possibly be
      impressed in no other manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Best of all, it is the physician who dominates the action. There is no
      sentimentalizing. There is no weak and morbid handling of the theme. The
      doctor appears in his ideal function, as the modern high-priest of truth.
      Around him writhe the victims of ignorance and the criminals of
      conventional cruelty. Kind, stern, high-minded, clear-headed, yet
      human-hearted, he towers over all, as the master.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is as it should be. The man to say the word to save the world of
      ignorant wretches, cursed by the clouds and darkness a mistaken modesty
      has thrown around a life-and-death instinct, is the physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only question is this: Is this play decent? My answer is that it is
      the decentest play that has been in New York for a year. It is so decent
      that it is religious.&mdash;HEARST'S MAGAZINE.
    </p>
    <p>
      The play is, above all, a powerful plea for the tearing away of the veil
      of mystery that has so universally shrouded this subject of the penalty of
      sexual immorality. It is a plea for light on this hidden danger, that
      fathers and mothers, young men and young women, may know the terrible
      price that must be paid, not only by the generation that violates the law,
      but by the generations to come. It is a serious question just how the
      education of men and women, especially young men and young women, in the
      vital matters of sex relationship should be carried on. One thing is sure,
      however. The worst possible way is the one which has so often been
      followed in the past&mdash;not to carry it on at all but to ignore it.&mdash;THE
      OUTLOOK.
    </p>
    <p>
      It (DAMAGED GOODS) is, of course, a masterpiece of "thesis drama,"&mdash;an
      argument, dogmatic, insistent, inescapable, cumulative, between science
      and common sense, on one side, and love, of various types, on the other.
      It is what Mr. Bernard Shaw has called a "drama of discussion"; it has the
      splendid movement of the best Shaw plays, unrelieved&mdash;and undiluted&mdash;by
      Shavian paradox, wit, and irony. We imagine that many audiences at the
      Fulton Theater were astonished at the play's showing of sheer strength as
      acted drama. Possibly it might not interest the general public; probably
      it would be inadvisable to present it to them. But no thinking person,
      with the most casual interest in current social evils, could listen to the
      version of Richard Bennett, Wilton Lackaye, and their associates, without
      being gripped by the power of Brieux's message.&mdash;THE DIAL.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a wonder that the world has been so long in getting hold of this
      play, which is one of France's most valuable contributions to the drama.
      Its history is interesting. Brieux wrote it over ten years ago. Antoine
      produced it at his theater and Paris immediately censored it, but soon
      thought better of it and removed the ban. During the summer of 1910 it was
      played in Brussels before crowded houses, for then the city was thronged
      with visitors to the exposition. Finally New York got it last spring and
      eugenic enthusiasts and doctors everywhere have welcomed it. &mdash;THE
      INDEPENDENT.

      23 Monroe Street Bklyn. August 1, 1913.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Richard Bennett, New York City, N.Y. My Dear Mr. Bennett:
    </p>
    <p>
      During the past twenty-one years since I entered public life, I have
      experienced many exciting hours under the influence of reformer, orator
      and actor, but, in this mood of retrospection, I do not know that I have
      ever passed through a more thrilling, terrible, and yet hopeful experience
      than last evening, while I listened to your interpretation of Eugene
      Brieux' "DAMAGED GOODS."
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been following your work with ever deepening interest. It is not
      too much to say that you have changed the thinking of the people of our
      country as to the social evil. At last, thank God, this conspiracy of
      silence is ended. No young man who sees "Damaged Goods" will ever be the
      same again. If I wanted to build around an innocent boy buttresses of fire
      and granite, and lend him triple armour against temptation and the
      assaults of evil, I would put him for one evening under your influence.
      That which the teacher, the preacher and the parent have failed to
      accomplish it has been given to you to achieve. You have done a work for
      which your generation owes you an immeasurable debt of gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall be delighted to have you use my Study of Social Diseases and
      Heredity in connection with your great reform.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all good wishes, I am, my dear Mr. Bennett, Faithfully yours,
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was four o'clock in the morning when George Dupont closed the door and
      came down the steps to the street. The first faint streaks of dawn were in
      the sky, and he noticed this with annoyance, because he knew that his hair
      was in disarray and his whole aspect disorderly; yet he dared not take a
      cab, because he feared to attract attention at home. When he reached the
      sidewalk, he glanced about him to make sure that no one had seen him leave
      the house, then started down the street, his eyes upon the sidewalk before
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      George had the feeling of the morning after. There are few men in this
      world of abundant sin who will not know what the phrase means. The fumes
      of the night had evaporated; he was quite sober now, quite free from
      excitement. He saw what he had done, and it seemed to him something black
      and disgusting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never had a walk seemed longer than the few blocks which he had to
      traverse to reach his home. He must get there before the maid was up,
      before the baker's boy called with the rolls; otherwise, what explanation
      could he give?&mdash;he who had always been such a moral man, who had been
      pointed out by mothers as an example to their sons.
    </p>
    <p>
      George thought of his own mother, and what she would think if she could
      know about his night's adventure. He thought again and again, with a pang
      of anguish, of Henriette. Could it be possible that a man who was engaged,
      whose marriage contract had actually been signed, who was soon to possess
      the love of a beautiful and noble girl&mdash;that such a man could have
      been weak enough and base enough to let himself be trapped into such a low
      action?
    </p>
    <p>
      He went back over the whole series of events, shuddering at them, trying
      to realize how they had happened, trying to excuse himself for them. He
      had not intended such a culmination; he had never meant to do such a thing
      in his life. He had not thought of any harm when he had accepted the
      invitation to the supper party with his old companions from the law
      school. Of course, he had known that several of these chums led "fast"
      lives&mdash;but, then, surely a fellow could go to a friend's rooms for a
      lark without harm!
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered the girl who had sat by his side at the table. She had come
      with a friend who was a married woman, and so he had assumed that she was
      all right. George remembered how embarrassed he had been when first he had
      noticed her glances at him. But then the wine had begun to go to his head&mdash;he
      was one of those unfortunate wretches who cannot drink wine at all. He had
      offered to take the girl home in a cab, and on the way he had lost his
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! What a wretched thing it was. He could hardly believe that it was he
      who had spoken those frenzied words; and yet he must have spoken them,
      because he remembered them. He remembered that it had taken a long time to
      persuade her. He had had to promise her a ring like the one her married
      friend wore. Before they entered her home she had made him take off his
      shoes, so that the porter might not hear them. This had struck George
      particularly, because, even flushed with excitement as he was, he had not
      forgotten the warnings his father had given him as to the dangers of
      contact with strange women. He had thought to himself, "This girl must be
      safe. It is probably the first time she has ever done such a thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      But now George could get but little consolation out of that idea. He was
      suffering intensely&mdash;the emotion described by the poet in the bitter
      words about "Time's moving finger having writ." His mind, seeking some
      explanation, some justification, went back to the events before that
      night. With a sudden pang of yearning, he thought of Lizette. She was a
      decent girl, and had kept him decent, and he was lonely without her. He
      had been so afraid of being found out that he had given her up when he
      became engaged; but now for a while he felt that he would have to break
      his resolution, and pay his regular Sunday visit to the little flat in the
      working-class portion of Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was while George was fitting himself for the same career as his father&mdash;that
      of notary&mdash;that he had made the acquaintance of the young working
      girl. It may not be easy to believe, but Lizette had really been a decent
      girl. She had a family to take care of, and was in need. There was a
      grandmother in poor health, a father not much better, and three little
      brothers; so Lizette did not very long resist George Dupont, and he felt
      quite virtuous in giving her sufficient money to take care of these
      unfortunate people. Among people of his class it was considered proper to
      take such things if one paid for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the family of this working girl were grateful to him. They adored him,
      and they called him Uncle Raoul (for of course he had not been so foolish
      as to give them his true name).
    </p>
    <p>
      Since George was paying for Lizette, he felt he had the right to control
      her life. He gave her fair warning concerning his attitude. If she
      deceived him he would leave her immediately. He told this to her relatives
      also, and so he had them all watching her. She was never trusted out
      alone. Every Sunday George went to spend the day with his little "family,"
      so that his coming became almost a matter of tradition. He interested her
      in church affairs&mdash;mass and vespers were her regular occasions for
      excursions. George rented two seats, and the grandmother went with her to
      the services. The simple people were proud to see their name engraved upon
      the brass plate of the pew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason for all these precautions was George's terror of disease. He
      had been warned by his father as to the dangers which young men encounter
      in their amours. And these lessons had sunk deep into George's heart; he
      had made up his mind that whatever his friends might do, he, for one,
      would protect himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      That did not mean, of course, that he intended to live a virtuous life;
      such was the custom among young men of his class, not had it probably ever
      occurred to his father that it was possible for a young man to do such a
      thing. The French have a phrase, "l'homme moyen sensuel"&mdash;the average
      sensual man. And George was such a man. He had no noble idealisms, no
      particular reverence for women. The basis of his attitude was a purely
      selfish one; he wanted to enjoy himself, and at the same time to keep out
      of trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not find any happiness in the renunciation which he imposed upon
      himself; he had no religious ideas about it. On the contrary, he suffered
      keenly, and was bitter because he had no share in the amusements of his
      friends. He stuck to his work and forced himself to keep regular hours,
      preparing for his law examinations. But all the time he was longing for
      adventures. And, of course, this could not go on forever, for the motive
      of fear alone is not sufficient to subdue the sexual urge in a
      full-blooded young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The affair with Lizette might have continued much longer had it not been
      for the fact that his father died. He died quite suddenly, while George
      was away on a trip. The son came back to console his broken-hearted
      mother, and in the two week they spent in the country together the mother
      broached a plan to him. The last wish of the dying man had been that his
      son should be fixed in life. In the midst of his intense suffering he had
      been able to think about the matter, and had named the girl whom he wished
      George to marry. Naturally, George waited with some interest to learn who
      this might be. He was surprised when his mother told him that it was his
      cousin, Henriette Loches.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not keep his emotion from revealing itself in his face. "It
      doesn't please you?" asked his mother, with a tone disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why no, mother," he answered. "It's not that. It just surprises me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why?" asked the mother. "Henriette is a lovely girl and a good girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I know," said George; "but then she is my cousin, and&mdash;" He
      blushed a little with embarrassment. "I had never thought of her in that
      way."
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Dupont laid her hand upon her son's. "Yes, George," she said
      tenderly. "I know. You are such a good boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, of course, George did not feel that he was quite such a good boy; but
      his mother was a deeply religious woman, who had no idea of the truth
      about the majority of men. She would never have got over the shock if he
      had told her about himself, and so he had to pretend to be just what she
      thought him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me," she continued, after a pause, "have you never felt the least
      bit in love?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why no&mdash;I don't think so," George stammered, becoming conscious of a
      sudden rise of temperature in his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because," said his mother, "it is really time that you were settled in
      life. Your father said that we should have seen to it before, and now it
      is my duty to see to it. It is not good for you to live alone so long."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, mother, I have YOU," said George generously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some day the Lord may take me away," was the reply. "I am getting old.
      And, George, dear&mdash;" Here suddenly her voice began to tremble with
      feeling&mdash;"I would like to see my baby grandchildren before I go. You
      cannot imagine what it would mean to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Dupont saw how much this subject distressed her son, so she went on
      to the more worldly aspects of the matter. Henriette's father was
      well-to-do, and he would give her a good dowry. She was a charming and
      accomplished girl. Everybody would consider him most fortunate if the
      match could be arranged. Also, there was an elderly aunt to whom Madame
      Dupont had spoken, and who was much taken with the idea. She owned a great
      deal of property and would surely help the young couple.
    </p>
    <p>
      George did not see just how he could object to this proposition, even if
      he had wanted to. What reason could he give for such a course? He could
      not explain that he already had a family&mdash;with stepchildren, so to
      speak, who adored him. And what could he say to his mother's obsession, to
      which she came back again and again&mdash;her longing to see her
      grandchildren before she died? Madame Dupont waited only long enough for
      George to stammer out a few protestations, and then in the next breath to
      take them back; after which she proceeded to go ahead with the match. The
      family lawyers conferred together, and the terms of the settlement were
      worked out and agreed upon. It happened that immediately afterwards George
      learned of an opportunity to purchase the practice of a notary, who was
      ready to retire from business in two months' time. Henriette's father
      consented to advance a portion of her dowry for this purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus George was safely started upon the same career as his father, and
      this was to him a source of satisfaction which he did not attempt to deny,
      either to himself of to any one else. George was a cautious young man, who
      came of a frugal and saving stock. He had always been taught that it was
      his primary duty to make certain of a reasonable amount of comfort. From
      his earliest days, he had been taught to regard material success as the
      greatest goal in life, and he would never have dreamed of engaging himself
      to a girl without money. But when he had the good fortune to meet one who
      possessed desirable personal qualities in addition to money, he was not in
      the least barred from appreciating those qualities. They were, so to
      speak, the sauce which went with the meat, and it seemed to him that in
      this case the sauce was of the very best.
    </p>
    <p>
      George&mdash;a big fellow of twenty-six, with large, round eyes and a
      good-natured countenance&mdash;was full blooded, well fed, with a hearty
      laugh which spoke of unimpaired contentment, a soul untroubled in its
      deeps. He seemed to himself the luckiest fellow in the whole round world;
      he could not think what he had done to deserve the good fortune of
      possessing such a girl as Henriette. He was ordinarily of a somewhat
      sentimental turn&mdash;easily influenced by women and sensitive to their
      charms. Moreover, his relationship with Lizette had softened him. He had
      learned to love the young working girl, and now Henriette, it seemed, was
      to reap the benefit of his experience with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, he found himself always with memories of Lizette in his
      relationships with the girl who was to be his wife. When the engagement
      was announced, and he claimed his first kiss from his bride-to-be, as he
      placed a ring upon her finger, he remembered the first time he had kissed
      Lizette, and a double blush suffused his round countenance. When he walked
      arm and arm with Henriette in the garden he remembered how he had walked
      just so with the other girl, and he was interested to compare the words of
      the two. He remembered what a good time had had when he had taken Lizette
      and her little family for a picnic upon one of the excursion steamers
      which run down the River Seine. Immediately he decided that he would like
      to take Henriette on such a picnic, and he persuaded an aunt of
      Henriette's to go with her as a chaperon. George took his bride-to-be to
      the same little inn where he had lunch before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus he was always haunted by memories, some of which made him cheerful
      and some of which made him mildly sad. He soon got used to the idea, and
      did not find it awkward, except when he had to suppress the impulse to
      tell Henriette something which Lizette had said, or some funny incident
      which had happened in the home of the little family. Sometimes he found
      himself thinking that it was a shame to have to suppress these impulses.
      There must be something wrong, he thought, with a social system which made
      it necessary for him to hide a thing which was so obvious and so sensible.
      Here he was, a man twenty-six years of age; he could not have afforded to
      marry earlier, nor could he, as he thought, have been expected to lead a
      continent life. And he had really loved Lizette; she was really a good
      girl. Yet, if Henriette had got any idea of it, she would have been
      horrified and indignant&mdash;she might even have broken off the
      engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, too, there was Henriette's father, a personage of great dignity
      and importance. M. Loches was a deputy of the French Parliament, from a
      district in the provinces. He was a man of upright life, and a man who
      made a great deal of that upright life&mdash;keeping it on a pedestal
      where everyone might observe it. It was impossible to imagine M. Loches in
      an undignified or compromising situation&mdash;such as the younger man
      found himself facing in the matter of Lizette.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more he thought about it the more nervous and anxious George became.
      Then it was decided it would be necessary for him to break with the girl,
      and be "good" until the time of his marriage. Dear little soft-eyed
      Lizette&mdash;he did not dare to face her personally; he could never bear
      to say good-by, he felt. Instead, he went to the father, who as a man
      could be expected to understand the situation. George was embarrassed and
      not a little nervous about it; for although he had never misrepresented
      his attitude to the family, one could never feel entirely free from the
      possibility of blackmail in such cases. However, Lizette's father behaved
      decently, and was duly grateful for the moderate sum of money which George
      handed him in parting. He promised to break the news gently to Lizette,
      and George went away with his mind made up that he would never see her
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      This resolution he kept, and he considered himself very virtuous in doing
      it. But the truth was that he had grown used to intimacy with a woman, and
      was restless without it. And that, he told himself, was why he yielded to
      the shameful temptation the night of that fatal supper party.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paid for the misadventure liberally in remorse. He felt that he had
      been a wretch, that he had disgraced himself forever, that he had proved
      himself unworthy of the pure girl he was to marry. So keen was his feeling
      that it was several days before he could bring himself to see Henriette
      again; and when he went, it was with a mind filled with a brand-new set of
      resolutions. It was the last time that he would ever fall into error. He
      would be a new man from then on. He thanked God that there was no chance
      of his sin being known, that he might have an opportunity to prove his new
      determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      So intense were his feelings that he could not help betraying a part of
      them to Henriette. They sat in the garden one soft summer evening, with
      Henriette's mother occupied with her crocheting at a decorous distance.
      George, in reverent and humble mood, began to drop vague hints that he was
      really unworthy of his bride-to-be. He said that he had not always been as
      good as he should have been; he said that her purity and sweetness had
      awakened in him new ideals; so that he felt his old life had been full of
      blunders. Henriette, of course, had but the vaguest of ideas as to what
      the blunders of a tender and generous young man like George might be. So
      she only loved him the more for his humility, and was flattered to have
      such a fine effect upon him, to awaken in him such moods of exaltation.
      When he told her that all men were bad, and that no man was worthy of such
      a beautiful love, she was quite ravished, and wiped away tears from her
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would have been a shame to spoil such a heavenly mood by telling the
      real truth. Instead, George contented himself with telling of the new
      resolutions he had formed. After all, they were the things which really
      mattered; for Henriette was going to live with his future, not with his
      past.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to George a most wonderful thing, this innocence of a young
      girl, which enabled her to move through a world of wickedness with
      unpolluted mind. It was a touching thing; and also, as a prudent young man
      could not help realizing, a most convenient thing. He realized the
      importance of preserving it, and thought that if he ever had a daughter,
      he would protect her as rigidly as Henriette had been protected. He made
      haste to shy off from the subject of his "badness" and to turn the
      conversation with what seemed a clever jest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I am going to be so good," he said, "don't forget that you will have
      to be good also!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will try," said Henriette, who was still serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will have to try hard," he persisted. "You will find that you have a
      very jealous husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will I?" said Henriette, beaming with happiness&mdash;for when a woman is
      very much in love she doesn't in the least object to the man's being
      jealous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, indeed," smiled George. "I'll always be watching you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Watching me?" echoed the girl with a surprised look.
    </p>
    <p>
      And immediately he felt ashamed of himself for his jest. There could be no
      need to watch Henriette, and it was bad taste even to joke about it at
      such a time. That was one of the ideas which he had brought with him from
      his world of evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth was, however, that George would always be a suspicious husband;
      nothing could ever change that fact, for there was something in his own
      conscience which he could not get out, and which would make it impossible
      for him to be at ease as a married man. It was the memory of something
      which had happened earlier in his life before he met Lizette. There had
      been one earlier experience, with the wife of his dearest friend. She had
      been much younger than her husband, and had betrayed an interest in
      George, who had yielded to the temptation. For several years the intrigue
      continued, and George considered it a good solution of a young man's
      problem. There had been no danger of contamination, for he knew that his
      friend was a man of pure and rigid morals, a jealous man who watched his
      wife, and did not permit her to contract those new relations which are
      always dangerous. As for George, he helped in this worthy work, keeping
      the woman in terror of some disease. He told her that almost all men were
      infected, for he hoped by this means to keep her from deceiving him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am aware that this may seem a dreadful story. As I do not want anyone to
      think too ill of George Dupont, I ought, perhaps, to point out that people
      feel differently about these matters in France. In judging the unfortunate
      young man, we must judge him by the customs of his own country, and not by
      ours. In France, they are accustomed to what is called the MARIAGE DE
      CONVENANCE. The young girl is not permitted to go about and make her own
      friends and decide which one of them she prefers for her husband; on the
      contrary, she is strictly guarded, her training often is of a religious
      nature, and her marriage is a matter of business, to be considered and
      decided by her parents and those of the young man. Now, whatever we may
      think right, it is humanly certain that where marriages are made in that
      way, the need of men and women for sympathy and for passionate interest
      will often lead to the forming of irregular relationships after marriage.
      It is not possible to present statistics as to the number of such
      irregular relationships in Parisian society; but in the books which he
      read and in the plays which he saw, George found everything to encourage
      him to think that it was a romantic and delightful thing to keep up a
      secret intrigue with the wife of his best friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should also, perhaps, be pointed out that we are here telling the
      truth, and the whole truth, about George Dupont; and that it is not
      customary to tell this about men, either in real life or in novels. There
      is a great deal of concealment in the world about matters of sex; and in
      such matters the truth-telling man is apt to suffer in reputation in
      comparison with the truth-concealing one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor had George really been altogether callous about the thing. It had
      happened that his best friend had died in his arms; and this had so
      affected the guilty pair that they had felt their relationship was no
      longer possible. She had withdrawn to nurse her grief alone, and George
      had been so deeply affected that he had avoided affairs and entanglements
      with women until his meeting with Lizette.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was now in the far distant past, but it had made a deeper
      impression upon George than he perhaps realized, and it was now working in
      his mind and marring his happiness. Here was a girl who loved him with a
      noble and unselfish and whole-hearted love&mdash;and yet he would never be
      able to trust her as she deserved, but would always have suspicions
      lurking in the back of his mind. He would be unable to have his friends
      intimate in his home, because of the memory of what he had once done to a
      friend. It was a subtle kind of punishment. But so it is that Nature often
      finds ways of punishing us, without our even being aware of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was all for the future, however. At present, George was happy. He put
      his black sin behind him, feeling that he had obtained absolution by his
      confession to Henriette. Day by day, as he realized his good fortune, his
      round face beamed with more and yet more joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went for a little trip to Henriette's home in the country. It was a
      simple village, and they took walks in the country, and stopped to refresh
      themselves at a farmhouse occupied by one of M. Loches' tenants. Here was
      a rosy and buxom peasant woman, with a nursing child in her arms. She was
      destined a couple of years later to be the foster-mother of Henriette's
      little girl and to play an important part in her life. But the pair had no
      idea of that at present. They simply saw a proud and happy mother, and
      Henriette played with the baby, giving vent to childish delight. Then
      suddenly she looked up and saw that George was watching her, and as she
      read his thoughts a beautiful blush suffused her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for George, he turned away and went out under the blue sky in a kind of
      ecstasy. Life seemed very wonderful to him just then; he had found its
      supreme happiness, which was love. He was really getting quite mad about
      Henriette, he told himself. He could hardly believe that the day was
      coming when he would be able to clasp her in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the blue sky of George's happiness there was one little cloud of
      storm. As often happens with storm-clouds, it was so small that at first
      he paid no attention to it at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      He noted upon his body one day a tiny ulcer. At first he treated it with
      salve purchased from an apothecary. Then after a week or two, when this
      had no effect, he began to feel uncomfortable. He remembered suddenly he
      had heard about the symptoms of an unmentionable, dreadful disease, and a
      vague terror took possession of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For days he tried to put it to one side. The idea was nonsense, it was
      absurd in connection with a woman so respectable! But the thought would
      not be put away, and finally he went to a school friend, who was a man of
      the world, and got him to talk on the subject. Of course, George had to be
      careful, so that his friend should not suspect that he had any special
      purpose in mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The friend was willing to talk. It was a vile disease, he said; but one
      was foolish to bother about it, because it was so rare. There were other
      diseases which fellows got, which nearly every fellow had, and to which
      none of them paid any attention. But one seldom met anyone who had the red
      plague that George dreaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet," he added, "according to the books, it isn't so uncommon. I
      suppose the truth is that people hide it. A chap naturally wouldn't tell,
      when he knew it would damn him for life."
    </p>
    <p>
      George had a sick sensation inside of him. "Is it as bad as that?" he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," said the other, "Should you want to have anything to do with
      a person who had it? Should you be willing to room with him or travel with
      him? You wouldn't even want to shake hands with him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I suppose not," said George, feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remember," continued the other, "an old fellow who used to live out in
      the country near me. He was not so very old, either, but he looked it. He
      had to be pushed around in a wheel-chair. People said he had locomotor
      ataxia, but that really meant syphilis. We boys used to poke all kinds of
      fun at him because one windy day his hat and his wig were blown off
      together, and we discovered that he was as bald as an egg. We used to make
      jokes about his automobile, as we called it. It had a little handle in
      front, instead of a steering-wheel, and a man behind to push, instead of
      an engine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How horrible!" remarked George with genuine feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remember the poor devil had a paralysis soon after," continued the
      friend, quite carelessly. "He could not steer any more, and also he lost
      his voice. When you met him he would look at you as it he thought he was
      talking, but all he could say was 'Ga-ga-ga'."
    </p>
    <p>
      George went away from this conversation in a cold sweat. He told himself
      over and over again that he was a fool, but still he could not get the
      hellish idea out of his mind. He found himself brooding over it all day
      and lying awake at night, haunted by images of himself in a wheel-chair,
      and without any hair on his head. He realized that the sensible thing
      would be for him to go to a doctor and make certain about his condition;
      but he could not bring himself to face the ordeal&mdash;he was ashamed to
      admit to a doctor that he had laid himself open to such a taint.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to lose the radiant expression from his round and rosy face. He
      had less appetite, and his moods of depression became so frequent that he
      could not hide then even from Henriette. She asked him once or twice if
      there were not something the matter with him, and he laughed&mdash;a
      forced and hurried laugh&mdash;and told her that he had sat up too late
      the night before, worrying over the matter of his examinations. Oh, what a
      cruel thing it was that a man who stood in the very gateway of such a
      garden of delight should be tormented and made miserable by this loathsome
      idea!
    </p>
    <p>
      The disturbing symptom still continued, and so at last George purchased a
      medical book, dealing with the subject of the disease. Then, indeed, he
      opened up a chamber of horrors; he made up his mind an abiding place of
      ghastly images. In the book there were pictures of things so awful that he
      turned white, and trembled like a leaf, and had to close the volume and
      hide it in the bottom of his trunk. But he could not banish the pictures
      from his mind. Worst of all, he could not forget the description of the
      first symptom of the disease, which seemed to correspond exactly with his
      own. So at last he made up his mind he must ascertain definitely the truth
      about his condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to think over plans for seeing a doctor. He had heard somewhere a
      story about a young fellow who had fallen into the hands of a quack, and
      been ruined forever. So he decided that he would consult only the best
      authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got the names of the best-known works on the subject from a bookstore,
      and found that the author of one of these books was practicing in Paris as
      a specialist. Two or three days elapsed before he was able to get up the
      courage to call on this doctor. And oh, the shame and horror of sitting in
      his waiting-room with the other people, none of whom dared to look each
      other in the eyes! They must all be afflicted, George thought, and he
      glanced at them furtively, looking for the various symptoms of which he
      had read. Or were there, perhaps, some like himself&mdash;merely victims
      of a foolish error, coming to have the hag of dread pulled from off their
      backs?
    </p>
    <p>
      And then suddenly, while he was speculating, there stood the doctor,
      signaling to him. His turn had come!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      The doctor was a man about forty years of age, robust, with every
      appearance of a strong character. In the buttonhole of the frock coat he
      wore was a red rosette, the decoration of some order. Confused and nervous
      as George was, he got a vague impression of the physician's richly
      furnished office, with its bronzes, marbles and tapestries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor signaled to the young man to be seated in the chair before his
      desk. George complied, and then, as he wiped away the perspiration from
      his forehead, stammered out a few words, explaining his errand. Of course,
      he said, it could not be true, but it was a man's duty not to take any
      chances in such a matter. "I have not been a man of loose life," he added;
      "I have not taken so many chances as other men."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor cut him short with the brief remark that one chance was all
      that was necessary. Instead of discussing such questions, he would make an
      examination. "We do not say positively in these cases until we have made a
      blood test. That is the one way to avoid the possibility of mistake."
    </p>
    <p>
      A drop of blood was squeezed out of George's finger on to a little glass
      plate. The doctor retired to an adjoining room, and the victim sat alone
      in the office, deriving no enjoyment from the works of art which
      surrounded him, but feeling like a prisoner who sits in the dock with his
      life at stake while the jury deliberates.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor returned, calm and impassive, and seated himself in his
      office-chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, doctor?" asked George. He was trembling with terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," was the reply, "there is no doubt whatever."
    </p>
    <p>
      George wiped his forehead. He could not credit the words. "No doubt
      whatever? In what sense?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the bad sense," said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to write a prescription, without seeming to notice how George
      turned page with terror. "Come," he said, after a silence, "you must have
      known the truth pretty well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, sir!" exclaimed George.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said the other, "you have syphilis."
    </p>
    <p>
      George was utterly stunned. "My God!" he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor, having finished his prescription, looked up and observed his
      condition. "Don't trouble yourself, sir. Out of every seven men you meet
      upon the street, in society, or at the theater, there is at least one who
      has been in your condition. One out of seven&mdash;fifteen per cent!"
    </p>
    <p>
      George was staring before him. He spoke low, as if to himself. "I know
      what I am going to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I know also," said the doctor, with a smile. "There is your
      prescription. You are going to take it to the drugstore and have it put
      up."
    </p>
    <p>
      George took the prescription, mechanically, but whispered, "No, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir, you are going to do as everybody else does."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, because my situation is not that of everybody else. I know what I am
      going to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      Said the doctor: "Five times out of ten, in the chair where you are
      sitting, people talk like that, perfectly sincerely. Each one believes
      himself more unhappy than all the others; but after thinking it over, and
      listening to me, they understand that this disease is a companion with
      whom one can live. Just as in every household, one gets along at the cost
      of mutual concessions, that's all. Come, sir, I tell you again, there is
      nothing about it that is not perfectly ordinary, perfectly natural,
      perfectly common; it is an accident which can happen to any one. It is a
      great mistake that people speak if this as the 'French Disease,' for there
      is none which is more universal. Under the picture of this disease,
      addressing myself to those who follow the oldest profession in the world,
      I would write the famous phrase: 'Here is your master. It is, it was, or
      it must be.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      George was putting the prescription into the outside pocket of his coat,
      stupidly, as if he did not know what he was doing. "But, sir," he
      exclaimed, "I should have been spared!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?" inquired the other. "Because you are a man of position, because you
      are rich? Look around you, sir. See these works of art in my room. Do you
      imagine that such things have been presented to me by chimney-sweeps?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Doctor," cried George, with a moan, "I have never been a libertine.
      There was never any one, you understand me, never any one could have been
      more careful in his pleasures. If I were to tell you that in all my life I
      have only had two mistresses, what would you answer to that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would answer, that a single one would have been sufficient to bring you
      to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir!" cried George. "It could not have been either of those women."
      He went on to tell the doctor about his first mistress, and then about
      Lizette. Finally he told about Henriette, how much he adored her. He could
      really use such a word&mdash;he loved her most tenderly. She was so good&mdash;and
      he had thought himself so lucky!
    </p>
    <p>
      As he went on, he could hardly keep from going to pieces. "I had
      everything," he exclaimed, "everything a man needed! All who knew me
      envied me. And then I had to let those fellows drag me off to that
      miserable supper-party! And now here I am! My future is ruined, my whole
      existence poisoned! What is to become of me? Everybody will avoid me&mdash;I
      shall be a pariah, a leper!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and then in sudden wild grief exclaimed, "Come, now! Would it
      not be better that I should take myself out of the way? At least, I should
      not suffer any more. You see that there could not be any one more unhappy
      than myself&mdash;not any one, I tell you, sir, not any one!" Completely
      overcome, he began to weep in his handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor got up, and went to him. "You must be a man," he said, "and not
      cry like a child."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But sir," cried the young man, with tears running down his cheeks, "if I
      had led a wild life, if I had passed my time in dissipation with chorus
      girls, then I could understand it. Then I would say that I had deserved
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor exclaimed with emphasis, "No, no! You would not say it.
      However, it is of no matter&mdash;go on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you that I would say it. I am honest, and I would say that I had
      deserved it. But no, I have worked, I have been a regular grind. And now,
      when I think of the shame that is in store for me, the disgusting things,
      the frightful catastrophes to which I am condemned&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is all this you are telling me?" asked the doctor, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I know, I know!" cried the other, and repeated what his friend had
      told him about the man in a wheel-chair. "And they used to call me
      handsome Raoul! That was my name&mdash;handsome Raoul!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, my dear sir," said the doctor, cheerfully, "wipe your eyes one last
      time, blow your nose, put your handkerchief into your pocket, and hear me
      dry-eyed."
    </p>
    <p>
      George obeyed mechanically. "But I give you fair warning," he said, "you
      are wasting your time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you&mdash;" began the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know exactly what you are going to tell me!" cried George.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, in that case, there is nothing more for you to do here&mdash;run
      along."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since I am here," said the patient submissively, "I will hear you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, then. I tell you that if you have the will and the
      perseverance, none of the things you fear will happen to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, it is your duty to tell me that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will tell you that there are one hundred thousand like you in Paris,
      alert, and seemingly well. Come, take what you were just saying&mdash;wheel-chairs.
      One doesn't see so many of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, that's true," said George.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And besides," added the doctor, "a good many people who ride in them are
      not there for the cause you think. There is no more reason why you should
      be the victim of a catastrophe than any of the one hundred thousand. The
      disease is serious, nothing more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You admit that it is a serious disease?" argued George.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of the most serious?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but you have the good fortune&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The GOOD fortune?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Relatively, if you please. You have the good fortune to be infected with
      one of the diseases over which we have the most certain control."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes," exclaimed George, "but the remedies are worse than the
      disease."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You deceive yourself," replied the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are trying to make me believe that I can be cured?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that I am not condemned?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I swear it to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are not deceiving yourself, you are not deceiving me? Why, I was told&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor laughed, contemptuously. "You were told, you were told! I'll
      wager that you know the laws of the Chinese concerning party-walls."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, naturally," said George. "But I don't see what they have to do with
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Instead of teaching you such things," was the reply, "it would have been
      a great deal better to have taught you about the nature and cause of
      diseases of this sort. Then you would have known how to avoid the
      contagion. Such knowledge should be spread abroad, for it is the most
      important knowledge in the world. It should be found in every newspaper."
    </p>
    <p>
      This remark gave George something of a shock, for his father had owned a
      little paper in the provinces, and he had a sudden vision of the way
      subscribers would have fallen off, if he had printed even so much as the
      name of this vile disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet," pursued the doctor, "you publish romances about adultery!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said George, "that's what the readers want."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They don't want the truth about venereal diseases," exclaimed the other.
      "If they knew the full truth, they would no longer think that adultery was
      romantic and interesting."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on to give his advice as to the means of avoiding such diseases.
      There was really but one rule. It was: To love but one woman, to take her
      as a virgin, and to love her so much that she would never deceive you.
      "Take that from me," added the doctor, "and teach it to your son, when you
      have one."
    </p>
    <p>
      George's attention was caught by this last sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean that I shall be able to have children?" he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Healthy children?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I repeat it to you; if you take care of yourself properly for a long
      time, conscientiously, you have little to fear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's certain?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ninety-nine times out of a hundred."
    </p>
    <p>
      George felt as if he had suddenly emerged from a dungeon. "Why, then," he
      exclaimed, "I shall be able to marry!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will be able to marry," was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are not deceiving me? You would not give me that hope, you would not
      expose me? How soon will I be able to marry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In three or four years," said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" cried George in consternation. "In three or four years? Not
      before?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is that? Am I going to be sick all that time? Why, you told me just
      now&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Said the doctor: "The disease will no longer be dangerous to you, yourself&mdash;but
      you will be dangerous to others."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," the young man cried, in despair, "I am to be married a month from
      now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is impossible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I cannot do any differently. The contract is ready! The banns have
      been published! I have given my word!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you are a great one!" the doctor laughed. "Just now you were
      looking for your revolver! Now you want to be married within the month."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Doctor, it is necessary!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I forbid it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As soon as I knew that the disease is not what I imagined, and that I
      could be cured, naturally I didn't want to commit suicide. And as soon as
      I make up my mind not to commit suicide, I have to take up my regular
      life. I have to keep my engagements; I have to get married."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes!" persisted George, with blind obstinacy. "Why, Doctor, if I
      didn't marry it would be a disaster. You are talking about something you
      don't understand. I, for my part&mdash;it is not that I am anxious to be
      married. As I told you, I had almost a second family. Lizette's little
      brothers adored me. But it is my aunt, an old maid; and, also, my mother
      is crazy about the idea. If I were to back out now, she would die of
      chagrin. My aunt would disinherit me, and she is the one who has the
      family fortune. Then, too, there is my father-in-law, a regular dragoon
      for his principles&mdash;severe, violent. He never makes a joke of serious
      things, and I tell you it would cost me dear, terribly dear. And, besides,
      I have given my word."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must take back your word."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You still insist?" exclaimed George, in despair. "But then, suppose that
      it were possible, how could I take back my signature which I put at the
      bottom of the deed? I have pledged myself to pay in two months for the
      attorney's practice I have purchased!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," said the doctor, "all these things&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are going to tell me that I was lacking in prudence, that I should
      never have disposed of my wife's dowry until after the honeymoon!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," said the doctor, again, "all these considerations are foreign to
      me. I am a physician, and nothing but a physician, and I can only tell you
      this: If you marry before three or four years, you will be a criminal."
    </p>
    <p>
      George broke out with a wild exclamation. "No sir, you are not merely a
      physician! You are also a confessor! You are not merely a scientist; and
      it is not enough for you that you observe me as you would some lifeless
      thing in your laboratory, and say, 'You have this; science says that; now
      go along with you.' All my existence depends upon you. It is your duty to
      listen to me, because when you know everything you will understand me, and
      you will find some way to cure me within a month."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," protested the doctor, "I wear myself out telling you that such
      means do not exist. I shall not be certain of your cure, as much as any
      one can be certain, in less than three or four years."
    </p>
    <p>
      George was almost beside himself. "I tell you you must find some means!
      Listen to me, sir&mdash;if I don't get married I don't get the dowry! And
      will you tell me how I can pay the notes I have signed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," said the doctor, dryly, "if that is the question, it is very simple&mdash;I
      will give you a plan to get out of the affair. You will go and get
      acquainted with some rich man; you will do everything you can to gain his
      confidence; and when you have succeeded, you will plunder him."
    </p>
    <p>
      George shook his head. "I am not in any mood for joking."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not joking," replied his adviser. "Rob that man, assassinate him
      even&mdash;that would be no worse crime than you would commit in taking a
      young girl in good health in order to get a portion of her dowry, when at
      the same time you would have to expose her to the frightful consequences
      of the disease which you would give her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Frightful consequences?" echoed George.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Consequences of which death would not be the most frightful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, sir, you were saying to me just now&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just now I did not tell you everything. Even reduced, suppressed a little
      by our remedies, the disease remains mysterious, menacing, and in its sum,
      sufficiently grave. So it would be an infamy to expose your fiancee in
      order to avoid an inconvenience, however great that might be."
    </p>
    <p>
      But George was still not to be convinced. Was it certain that this
      misfortune would befall Henriette, even with the best attention?
    </p>
    <p>
      Said the other: "I do not wish to lie to you. No, it is not absolutely
      certain, it is probable. And there is another truth which I wish to tell
      you now: our remedies are not infallible. In a certain number of cases&mdash;a
      very small number, scarcely five per cent&mdash;they have remained without
      effect. You might be one of those exceptions, your wife might be one. What
      then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will employ a word you used just now, yourself. We should have to
      expect the worst catastrophes."
    </p>
    <p>
      George sat in a state of complete despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me what to do, then," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can tell you only one thing: don't marry. You have a most serious
      blemish. It is as if you owed a debt. Perhaps no one will ever come to
      claim it; on the other hand, perhaps a pitiless creditor will come all at
      once, presenting a brutal demand for immediate payment. Come now&mdash;you
      are a business man. Marriage is a contract; to marry without saying
      anything&mdash;that means to enter into a bargain by means of passive
      dissimulation. That's the term, is it not? It is dishonesty, and it ought
      to come under the law."
    </p>
    <p>
      George, being a lawyer, could appreciate the argument, and could think of
      nothing to say to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What shall I do?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other answered, "Go to your father-in-law and tell him frankly the
      truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," cried the young man, wildly, "there will be no question then of
      three or four years' delay. He will refuse his consent altogether."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If that is the case," said the doctor, "don't tell him anything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I have to give him a reason, or I don't know what he will do. He is
      the sort of man to give himself to the worst violence, and again my
      fiancee would be lost to me. Listen, doctor. From everything I have said
      to you, you may perhaps think I am a mercenary man. It is true that I want
      to get along in the world, that is only natural. But Henriette has such
      qualities; she is so much better than I, that I love her, really, as
      people love in novels. My greatest grief&mdash;it is not to give up the
      practice I have bought&mdash;although, indeed, it would be a bitter blow
      to me; my greatest grief would be to lose Henriette. If you could only see
      her, if you only knew her&mdash;then you would understand. I have her
      picture here&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The young fellow took out his card-case. And offered a photograph to the
      doctor, who gently refused it. The other blushed with embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon," he said, "I am ridiculous. That happens to me,
      sometimes. Only, put yourself in my place&mdash;I love her so!" His voice
      broke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear boy," said the doctor, feelingly, "that is exactly why you ought
      not to marry her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," he cried, "if I back out without saying anything they will guess
      the truth, and I shall be dishonored."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One is not dishonored because one is ill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But with such a disease! People are so stupid. I myself, yesterday&mdash;I
      should have laughed at anyone who had got into such a plight; I should
      have avoided him, I should have despised him!" And suddenly George broke
      down again. "Oh!" he cried, "if I were the only one to suffer; but she&mdash;she
      is in love with me. I swear it to you! She is so good; and she will be so
      unhappy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor answered, "She would be unhappier later on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will be a scandal!" George exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will avoid one far greater," the other replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly George set his lips with resolution. He rose from his seat. He
      took several twenty-franc pieces from his pocket and laid them quietly
      upon the doctor's desk&mdash;paying the fee in cash, so that he would not
      have to give his name and address. He took up his gloves, his cane and his
      hat, and rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will think it over," he said. "I thank you, Doctor. I will come back
      next week as you have told me. That is&mdash;probably I will."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was about to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor rose, and he spoke in a voice of furious anger. "No," he said,
      "I shan't see you next week, and you won't even think it over. You came
      here knowing what you had; you came to ask advice of me, with the
      intention of paying no heed to it, unless it conformed to your wishes. A
      superficial honesty has driven you to take that chance in order to satisfy
      your conscience. You wanted to have somebody upon whom you could put off,
      bye and bye, the consequences of an act whose culpability you understand!
      No, don't protest! Many of those who come here think and act as you think,
      and as you wish to act; but the marriage made against my will has
      generally been the source of such calamities that now I am always afraid
      of not having been persuasive enough, and it even seems to me that I am a
      little to blame for these misfortunes. I should have been able to prevent
      them; they would not have happened if those who are the authors of them
      knew what I know and had seen what I have seen. Swear to me, sir, that you
      are going to break off that marriage!"
    </p>
    <p>
      George was greatly embarrassed, and unwilling to reply. "I cannot swear to
      you at all, Doctor; I can only tell you again that I will think it over."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That WHAT over?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What you have told me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What I have told you is true! You cannot bring any new objections; and I
      have answered those which you have presented to me; therefore, your mind
      ought to be made up."
    </p>
    <p>
      Groping for a reply, George hesitated. He could not deny that he had made
      inquiry about these matters before he had come to the doctor. But he said
      that he was not al all certain that he had this disease. The doctor
      declared it, and perhaps it was true, but the most learned physicians were
      sometimes deceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered something he had read in one of the medical books. "Dr.
      Ricord maintains that after a certain period the disease is no longer
      contagious. He has proven his contentions by examples. Today you produce
      new examples to show that he is wrong! Now, I want to do what's right, but
      surely I have the right to think it over. And when I think it over, I
      realize that all the evils with which you threaten me are only probable
      evils. In spite of your desire to terrify me, you have been forced to
      admit that possibly my marriage would not have any troublesome consequence
      for my wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor found difficulty in restraining himself. But he said, "Go on. I
      will answer you afterwards."
    </p>
    <p>
      And George blundered ahead in his desperation. "Your remedies are
      powerful, you tell me; and for the calamities of which you speak to befall
      me, I would have to be among the rare exceptions&mdash;also my wife would
      have to be among the number of those rare exceptions. If a mathematician
      were to apply the law of chance to these facts, the result of his
      operation would show but slight chance of a catastrophe, as compared with
      the absolute certainty of a series of misfortunes, sufferings, troubles,
      tears, and perhaps tragic accidents which the breaking of my engagement
      would cause. So I say that the mathematician&mdash;who is, even more than
      you, a man of science, a man of a more infallible science&mdash;the
      mathematician would conclude that wisdom was not with you doctors, but
      with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You believe it, sir!" exclaimed the other. "But you deceive yourself."
      And he continued, driving home his point with a finger which seemed to
      George to pierce his very soul. "Twenty cases identical with your own have
      been patiently observed, from the beginning to the end. Nineteen times the
      woman was infected by her husband; you hear me, sir, nineteen times out of
      twenty! You believe that the disease is without danger, and you take to
      yourself the right to expose your wife to what you call the chance of your
      being one of those exceptions, for whom our remedies are without effect.
      Very well; it is necessary that you should know the disease which your
      wife, without being consulted, will run a chance of contracting. Take that
      book, sir; it is the work of my teacher. Read it yourself. Here, I have
      marked the passage."
    </p>
    <p>
      He held out the open book; but George could not lift a hand to take it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do not wish to read it?" the other continued. "Listen to me." And in
      a voice trembling with passion, he read: "'I have watched the spectacle of
      an unfortunate young woman, turned into a veritable monster by means of a
      syphilitic infection. Her face, or rather let me say what was left of her
      face, was nothing but a flat surface seamed with scars.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      George covered his face, exclaiming, "Enough, sir! Have mercy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But the other cried, "No, no! I will go to the very end. I have a duty to
      perform, and I will not be stopped by the sensibility of your nerves."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on reading: "'Of the upper lip not a trace was left; the ridge of
      the upper gums appeared perfectly bare.'" But then at the young man's
      protests, his resolution failed him. "Come," he said, "I will stop. I am
      sorry for you&mdash;you who accept for another person, for the woman you
      say you love, the chance of a disease which you cannot even endure to hear
      described. Now, from whom did that woman get syphilis? It is not I who am
      speaking, it is the book. 'From a miserable scoundrel who was not afraid
      to enter into matrimony when he had a secondary eruption.' All that was
      established later on&mdash;'and who, moreover, had thought it best not to
      let his wife be treated for fear of awakening her suspicions!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor closed the book with a bang. "What that man has done, sir, is
      what you want to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      George was edging toward the door; he could no longer look the doctor in
      the eye. "I should deserve all those epithets and still more brutal ones
      if I should marry, knowing that my marriage would cause such horrors. But
      that I do not believe. You and your teachers&mdash;you are specialists,
      and consequently you are driven to attribute everything to the disease you
      make the subject of your studies. A tragic case, an exceptional case,
      holds a kind of fascination for you; you think it can never be talked
      about enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have heard that argument before," said the doctor, with an effort at
      patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me go on, I beg you," pleaded George. "You have told me that out of
      every seven men there is one syphilitic. You have told me that there are
      one hundred thousand in Paris, coming and going, alert, and apparently
      well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is true," said the doctor, "that there are one hundred thousand who
      are actually at this moment not visibly under the influence of the
      disease. But many thousands have passed into our hospitals, victims of the
      most frightful ravages that our poor bodies can support. These&mdash;you
      do not see them, and they do not count for you. But again, if it concerned
      no one but yourself, you might be able to argue thus. What I declare to
      you, what I affirm with all the violence of my conviction, is that you
      have not the right to expose a human creature to such chances&mdash;rare,
      as I know, but terrible, as I know still better. What have you to answer
      to that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing," stammered George, brought to his knees at last. "You are right
      about that. I don't know what to think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And in forbidding you marriage," continued the doctor, "is it the same as
      if I forbade it forever? Is it the same as if I told you that you could
      never be cured? On the contrary, I hold out to you every hope; but I
      demand of you a delay of three or four years, because it will take me that
      time to find out if you are among the number of those unfortunate ones
      whom I pity with all my heart, for whom the disease is without mercy;
      because during that time you will be dangerous to your wife and to your
      children. The children I have not yet mentioned to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the doctor's voice trembled slightly. He spoke with moving eloquence.
      "Come, sir, you are an honest man; you are too young for such things not
      to move you; you are not insensible to duty. It is impossible that I
      shan't be able to find a way to your heart, that I shan't be able to make
      you obey me. My emotion in speaking to you proves that I appreciate your
      suffering, that I suffer with you. It is in the name of my sincerity that
      I implore you. You have admitted it&mdash;that you have not the right to
      expose your wife to such miseries. But it is not only your wife that you
      strike; you may attack in her your own children. I exclude you for a
      moment from my thought&mdash;you and her. It is in the name of these
      innocents that I implore you; it is the future, it is the race that I
      defend. Listen to me, listen to me! Out of the twenty households of which
      I spoke, only fifteen had children; these fifteen had twenty-eight. Do you
      know how many out of these twenty-eight survived? Three, sir! Three out of
      twenty-eight! Syphilis is above everything a murderer of children. Herod
      reigns in France, and over all the earth, and begins each year his
      massacre of the innocents; and if it be not blasphemy against the
      sacredness of life, I say that the most happy are those who have
      disappeared. Visit our children's hospitals! We know too well the child of
      syphilitic parents; the type is classical; the doctors can pick it out
      anywhere. Those little old creatures who have the appearance of having
      already lived, and who have kept the stigmata of all out infirmities, of
      all our decay. They are the victims of fathers who have married, being
      ignorant of what you know&mdash;things which I should like to go and cry
      out in the public places."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor paused, and then in a solemn voice continued: "I have told you
      all, without exaggeration. Think it over. Consider the pros and cons; sum
      up the possible misfortunes and the certain miseries. But disregard
      yourself, and consider that there are in one side of the scales the
      misfortunes of others, and in the other your own. Take care that you are
      just."
    </p>
    <p>
      George was at last overcome. "Very well," he said, "I give way. I won't
      get married. I will invent some excuse; I will get a delay of six months.
      More than that, I cannot do."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor exclaimed, "I need three years&mdash;I need four years!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Doctor!" persisted George. "You can cure me in less time than that."
    </p>
    <p>
      The other answered, "No! No! No!"
    </p>
    <p>
      George caught him by the hand, imploringly. "Yes! Science in all
      powerful!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Science is not God," was the reply. "There are no longer any miracles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If only you wanted to do it!" cried the young man, hysterically. "You are
      a learned man; seek, invent, find something! Try some new plan with me;
      give me double the dose, ten times the does; make me suffer. I give myself
      up to you; I will endure everything&mdash;I swear it! There ought to be
      some way to cure me within six months. Listen to me! I tell you I can't
      answer for myself with that delay. Come; it is in the name of my wife, in
      the name of my children, that I implore you. Do something for them!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor had reached the limit of his patience. "Enough, sir!" he cried.
      "Enough!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But nothing could stop the wretched man. "On my knees!" he cried. "I put
      myself on my knees before you! Oh! If only you would do it! I would bless
      you; I would adore you, as one adores a god! All my gratitude, all my life&mdash;half
      my fortune! For mercy's sake, Doctor, do something; invent something; make
      some discovery&mdash;have pity!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor answered gravely, "Do you wish me to do more for you than for
      the others?"
    </p>
    <p>
      George answered, unblushingly, 'answered, unblushingly, "Yes!" He was
      beside himself with terror and distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other's reply was delivered in a solemn tone. "Understand, sir, for
      every one of out patients we do all that we can, whether it be the
      greatest personage, or the last comer to out hospital clinic. We have no
      secrets in reserve for those who are more fortunate, or less fortunate
      than the others, and who are in a hurry to be cured."
    </p>
    <p>
      George gazed at him for a moment in bewilderment and despair, and then
      suddenly bowed his head. "Good-by, Doctor," he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Au revoir, sir," the other corrected&mdash;with what proved to be
      prophetic understanding. For George was destined to see him again&mdash;even
      though he had made up his mind to the contrary!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      George Dupont had the most important decision of his life to make; but
      there was never very much doubt what his decision would be. One the one
      hand was the definite certainty that if he took the doctor's advice, he
      would wreck his business prospects, and perhaps also lose the woman he
      loved. On the other hand were vague and uncertain possibilities which it
      was difficult for him to make real to himself. It was all very well to
      wait a while to be cured of the dread disease; but to wait three or four
      years&mdash;that was simply preposterous!
    </p>
    <p>
      He decided to consult another physician. He would find one this time who
      would not be so particular, who would be willing to take some trouble to
      cure him quickly. He began to notice the advertisements which were
      scattered over the pages of the newspapers he read. There were apparently
      plenty of doctors in Paris who could cure him, who were willing to
      guarantee to cure him. After much hesitation, he picked out one whose
      advertisement sounded the most convincing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The office was located in a cheap quarter. It was a dingy place, not
      encumbered with works of art, but with a few books covered with dust. The
      doctor himself was stout and greasy, and he rubbed his hands with
      anticipation at the sight of so prosperous-looking a patient. But he was
      evidently a man of experience, for he knew exactly what was the matter
      with George, almost without the formality of an examination. Yes, he could
      cure him, quickly, he said. There had recently been great discoveries made&mdash;new
      methods which had not reached the bulk of the profession. He laughed at
      the idea of three or four years. That was the way with those specialists!
      When one got forty francs for a consultation, naturally, one was glad to
      drag out the case. There were tricks in the medical trade, as in all
      others. A doctor had to live; when he had a big name, he had to live
      expensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new physician wrote out two prescriptions, and patted George on the
      shoulder as he went away. There was no need for him to worry; he would
      surely be well in three months. If he would put off his marriage for six
      months, he would be doing everything within reason. And meantime, there
      was no need for him to worry himself&mdash;things would come out all
      right. So George went away, feeling as if a mountain had been lifted from
      his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to see Henriette that same evening, to get the matter settled.
      "Henriette," he said, "I have to tell you something very important&mdash;something
      rather painful. I hope you won't let it disturb you too much."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was gazing at him in alarm. "What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why," he said, blushing in spite of himself, and regretting that he had
      begun the matter so precipitately, "for some time I've not been feeling
      quite well. I've been having a slight cough. Have you noticed it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why no!" exclaimed Henriette, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, today I went to see a doctor, and he says that there is a
      possibility&mdash;you understand it is nothing very serious&mdash;but it
      might be&mdash;I might possibly have lung trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "George!" cried the girl in horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his hand upon hers. "Don't be frightened," he said. "It will be all
      right, only I have to take care of myself." How very dear of her, he
      thought&mdash;to be so much worried!
    </p>
    <p>
      "George, you ought to go away to the country!" she cried. "You have been
      working too hard. I always told you that if you shut yourself up so much&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going to take care of myself," he said. "I realize that it is
      necessary. I shall be all right&mdash;the doctor assured me there was no
      doubt of it, so you are not to distress yourself. But meantime, here is
      the trouble: I don't think it would be right for me to marry until I am
      perfectly well."
    </p>
    <p>
      Henriette gave an exclamation of dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure we should put it off," he went on, "it would be only fair to
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, George!" she protested. "Surely it can't be that serious!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We ought to wait," he said. "You ought not to take the chance of being
      married to a consumptive."
    </p>
    <p>
      The other protested in consternation. He did not look like a consumptive;
      she did not believe that he WAS a consumptive. She was willing to take her
      chances. She loved him, and she was not afraid. But George insisted&mdash;he
      was sure that he ought not to marry for six months.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did the doctor advise that?" asked Henriette.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," he replied, "but I made up my mind after talking to him that I must
      do the fair and honorable thing. I beg you to forgive me, and to believe
      that I know best."
    </p>
    <p>
      George stood firmly by this position, and so in the end she had to give
      way. It did not seem quite modest in her to continue persisting.
    </p>
    <p>
      George volunteered to write a letter to her father; and he hoped this
      would settle the matter without further discussion. But in this he was
      disappointed. There had to be a long correspondence with long arguments
      and protestations from Henriette's father and from his own mother. It
      seemed such a singular whim. Everybody persisted in diagnosing his
      symptoms, in questioning him about what the doctor had said, who the
      doctor was, how he had come to consult him&mdash;all of which, of course,
      was very embarrassing to George, who could not see why they had to make
      such a fuss. He took to cultivating a consumptive look, as well as he
      could imagine it; he took to coughing as he went about the house&mdash;and
      it was all he could do to keep from laughing, as he saw the look of dismay
      on his poor mother's face. After all, however, he told himself that he was
      not deceiving her, for the disease he had was quite as serious as
      tuberculosis.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very painful and very trying. But there was nothing that could be
      done about it; the marriage had been put off for six months, and in the
      meantime he and Henriette had to control their impatience and make the
      best of their situation. Six months was a long time; but what if it had
      been three or four years, as the other doctor had demanded? That would
      have been a veritable sentence of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      George, as we have seen, was conscientious, and regular and careful in his
      habits. He took the medicine which the new doctor prescribed for him; and
      day by day he watched, and to his great relief saw the troublesome
      symptoms gradually disappearing. He began to take heart, and to look
      forward to life with his former buoyancy. He had had a bad scare, but now
      everything was going to be all right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three or four months passed, and the doctor told him he was cured. He
      really was cured, so far as he could see. He was sorry, now, that he had
      asked for so long a delay from Henriette; but the new date for the wedding
      had been announced, and it would be awkward to change it again. George
      told himself that he was being "extra careful," and he was repaid for the
      inconvenience by the feeling of virtue derived from the delay. He was
      relieved that he did not have to cough any more, or to invent any more
      tales of his interviews with the imaginary lung-specialist. Sometimes he
      had guilty feelings because of all the lying he had had to do; but he told
      himself that it was for Henriette's sake. She loved him as much as he
      loved her. She would have suffered needless agonies had she known the
      truth; she would never have got over it&mdash;so it would have been a
      crime to tell her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He really loved her devotedly, thoroughly. From the beginning he had
      thought as much of her mental sufferings as he had of any physical harm
      that the dread disease might do to him. How could he possibly persuade
      himself to give her up, when he knew that the separation would break her
      heart and ruin her whole life? No; obviously, in such a dilemma, it was
      his duty to use his own best judgment, and get himself cured as quickly as
      possible. After that he would be true to her, he would take no more
      chances of a loathsome disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      The secret he was hiding made him feel humble&mdash;made him unusually
      gentle in his attitude towards the girl. He was a perfect lover, and she
      was ravished with happiness. She thought that all his sufferings were
      because of his love for her, and the delay which he had imposed out of his
      excess of conscientiousness. So she loved him more and more, and never was
      there a happier bride than Henriette Loches, when at last the great day
      arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went to the Riveria for their honeymoon, and then returned to live in
      the home which had belonged to George's father. The investment in the
      notary's practice had proven a good one, and so life held out every
      promise for the young couple. They were divinely happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while, the bride communicated to her husband the tidings that she
      was expecting a child. Then it seemed to George that the cup of his
      earthly bliss was full. His ailment had slipped far into the background of
      his thoughts, like an evil dream which he had forgotten. He put away the
      medicines in the bottom of his trunk and dismissed the whole matter from
      his mind. Henriette was well&mdash;a very picture of health, as every one
      agreed. The doctor had never seen a more promising young mother, he
      declared, and Madame Dupont, the elder, bloomed with fresh life and joy as
      she attended her daughter-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henriette went for the summer to her father's place in the provinces,
      which she and George had visited before their marriage. They drove out one
      day to the farm where they had stopped. The farmer's wife had a week-old
      baby, the sight of which made Henriette's heart leap with delight. He was
      such a very healthy baby that George conceived the idea that this would be
      the woman to nurse his own child, in case Henriette herself should not be
      able to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came back to the city, and there the baby was born. As George paced
      the floor, waiting for the news, the memory of his evil dreams came back
      to him. He remembered all the dreadful monstrosities of which he had read&mdash;infants
      that were born of syphilitic parents. His heart stood still when the nurse
      came into the room to tell him the tidings.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was all right; of course it was all right! He had been a fool, he
      told himself, as he stood in the darkened room and gazed at the wonderful
      little mite of life which was the fruit of his love. It was a perfect
      child, the doctor said&mdash;a little small, to be sure, but that was a
      defect which would soon be remedied. George kneeled by the bedside and
      kissed the hand of his wife, and went out of the room feeling as if he had
      escaped from a tomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      All went well, and after a couple of weeks Henriette was about the house
      again, laughing all day and singing with joy. But the baby did not gain
      quite as rapidly as the doctor had hoped, and it was decided that the
      country air would be better for her. So George and his mother paid a visit
      to the farm in the country, and arranged that the country woman should put
      her own child to nurse elsewhere and should become the foster-mother of
      little Gervaise.
    </p>
    <p>
      George paid a good price for the service, far more than would have been
      necessary, for the simple country woman was delighted with the idea of
      taking care of the grandchild of the deputy of her district. George came
      home and told his wife about this and had a merry time as he pictured the
      woman boasting about it to the travelers who stopped at her door. "Yes,
      ma'am, a great piece of luck I've got, ma'am. I've got the daughter of the
      daughter of our deputy&mdash;at your service ma'am. My! But she is as fat
      as out little calf&mdash;and so clever! She understands everything. A
      great piece of luck for me, ma'am. She's the daughter of the daughter of
      our deputy!" Henriette was vastly entertained, discovering in her husband
      a new talent, that of an actor.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for George's mother, she was hardly to be persuaded from staying in the
      country with the child. She went twice a week, to make sure that all went
      well. Henriette and she lived with the child's picture before them; they
      spent their time sewing on caps and underwear&mdash;all covered with laces
      and frills and pink and blue ribbons. Every day, when George came home
      from his work, he found some new article completed, and was ravished by
      the scent of some new kind of sachet powder. What a lucky man he was!
    </p>
    <p>
      You would think he must have been the happiest man in the whole city of
      Paris. But George, alas, had to pay the penalty for his early sins. There
      was, for instance, the deception he had practiced upon his friend, away
      back in the early days. Now he had friends of his own, and he could not
      keep these friends from visiting him; and so he was unquiet with the fear
      that some one of them might play upon him the same vile trick. Even in the
      midst of his radiant happiness, when he knew that Henriette was hanging
      upon his every word, trembling with delight when she heard his latchkey in
      the door&mdash;still he could not drive away the horrible thought that
      perhaps all this might be deception.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was his friend, Gustave, for example. He had been a friend of
      Henriette's before her marriage; he had even been in love with her at one
      time. And now he came sometimes to the house&mdash;once or twice when
      George was away! What did that mean? George wondered. He brooded over it
      all day, but dared not drop any hint to Henriette. But he took to setting
      little traps to catch her; for instance, he would call her up on the
      telephone, disguising his voice. "Hello! Hello! Is that you, Madame
      Dupont?" And when she answered, "It is I, sir," all unsuspecting, he would
      inquire, "Is George there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir," she replied. "Who is this speaking?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered, "It is I, Gustave. How are you this morning?" He wanted to
      see what she would answer. Would she perhaps say, "Very well, Gustave. How
      are you?"&mdash;in a tone which would betray too great intimacy!
    </p>
    <p>
      But Henriette was a sharp young person. The tone did not sound like
      Gustave's. She asked in bewilderment, "What?" and then again, "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      So, at last, George, afraid that his trick might be suspected, had to
      burst out laughing, and turn it into a joke. But when he came home and
      teased his wife about it, the laugh was not all on his side. Henriette had
      guessed the real meaning of his joke! She did not really mind&mdash;she
      took his jealousy as a sign of love, and was pleased with it. It is not
      until a third party come upon the scene that jealousy begins to be
      annoying.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she had a merry time teasing George. "You are a great fellow! You have
      no idea how well I understand you&mdash;and after only a year of
      marriage!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know me?" said the husband, curiously. (It is always so fascinating
      when anybody thinks she know us better than we know ourselves!) "Tell me,
      what do you think about me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are restless," said Henriette. "You are suspicious. You pass your
      time putting flies in your milk, and inventing wise schemes to get them
      out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you think that, do you?" said George, pleased to be talked about.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not annoyed," she answered. "You have always been that way&mdash;and
      I know that it's because at bottom you are timid and disposed to suffer.
      And then, too, perhaps you have reasons for not having confidence in a
      wife's intimate friends&mdash;lady-killer that you are!"
    </p>
    <p>
      George found this rather embarrassing; but he dared not show it, so he
      laughed gayly. "I don't know what you mean," he said&mdash;"upon my word I
      don't. But it is a trick I would not advise everybody to try."
    </p>
    <p>
      There were other embarrassing moments, caused by George's having things to
      conceal. There was, for instance, the matter of the six months' delay in
      the marriage&mdash;about which Henriette would never stop talking. She
      begrudged the time, because she had got the idea that little Gervaise was
      six months younger than she otherwise would have been. "That shows your
      timidity again," she would say. "The idea of your having imagined yourself
      a consumptive!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor George had to defend himself. "I didn't tell you half the truth,
      because I was afraid of upsetting you. It seemed I had the beginning of
      chronic bronchitis. I felt it quite keenly whenever I took a breath, a
      deep breath&mdash;look, like this. Yes&mdash;I felt&mdash;here and there,
      on each side of the chest, a heaviness&mdash;a difficulty&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The idea of taking six months to cure you of a thing like that!"
      exclaimed Henriette. "And making our baby six months younger than she
      ought to be!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," laughed George, "that means that we shall have her so much the
      longer! She will get married six months later!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, dear me," responded the other, "let us not talk about such things! I
      am already worried, thinking she will get married some day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For my part," said George, "I see myself mounting with her on my arm the
      staircase of the Madeleine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why the Madeleine?" exclaimed his wife. "Such a very magnificent church!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know&mdash;I see her under her white veil, and myself all dressed
      up, and with an order."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With an order!" laughed Henriette. "What do you expect to do to win an
      order?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know that&mdash;but I see myself with it. Explain it as you will,
      I see myself with an order. I see it all, exactly as if I were there&mdash;the
      Swiss guard with his white stockings and the halbard, and the little
      milliner's assistants and the scullion lined up staring."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is far off&mdash;all that," said Henriette. "I don't like to talk of
      it. I prefer her as a baby. I want her to grow up&mdash;but then I change
      my mind and think I don't. I know your mother doesn't. Do you know, I
      don't believe she ever thinks about anything but her little Gervaise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe you," said the father. "The child can certainly boast of having
      a grandmother who loves her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Also, I adore your mother," declared Henriette. "She makes me forget my
      misfortune in not having my own mother. She is so good!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are all like that in our family," put in George.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really," laughed the wife. "Well, anyhow&mdash;the last time that we went
      down in the country with her&mdash;you had gone out, I don't know where
      you had gone&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To see the sixteenth-century chest," suggested the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes," laughed Henriette; "your famous chest!" (You must excuse this
      little family chatter of theirs&mdash;they were so much in love with each
      other!)
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't let's talk about that," objected George. "You were saying&mdash;?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were not there. The nurse was out at mass, I think&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or at the wine merchant's! Go on, go on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I was in the little room, and mother dear thought she was all alone
      with Gervaise. I was listening; she was talking to the baby&mdash;all
      sorts of nonsense, pretty little words&mdash;stupid, if you like, but
      tender. I wanted to laugh, and at the same time I wanted to weep."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps she called her 'my dear little Savior'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly! Did you hear her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;but that is what she used to call me when I was little."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was that day she swore that the little one had recognized her, and
      laughed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then another time, when I went into her room&mdash;mother's room&mdash;she
      didn't hear me because the door was open, but I saw her. She was in
      ecstasy before the little boots which the baby wore at baptism&mdash;you
      know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen, then. She had taken them and she was embracing them!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what did you say then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing; I stole out very softly, and I sent across the threshold a great
      kiss to the dear grandmother!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Henriette sat for a moment in thought. "It didn't take her very long," she
      remarked, "today when she got the letter from the nurse. I imagine she
      caught the eight-fifty-nine train!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any yet," laughed George, "it was really nothing at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh no," said his wife. "Yet after all, perhaps she was right&mdash;and
      perhaps I ought to have gone with her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How charming you are, my poor Henriette! You believe everything you are
      told. I, for my part, divined right away the truth. The nurse was simply
      playing a game on us; she wanted a raise. Will you bet? Come, I'll bet you
      something. What would you like to bet? You don't want to? Come, I'll bet
      you a lovely necklace&mdash;you know, with a big pearl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Henriette, who had suddenly lost her mood of gayety. "I should
      be too much afraid of winning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop!" laughed her husband. "Don't you believe I love her as much as you
      love her&mdash;my little duck? Do you know how old she is? I mean her
      EXACT age?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Henriette sat knitting her brows, trying to figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" he exploded. "You see you don't know! She is ninety-one days and
      eight hours! Ha, ha! Imagine when she will be able to walk all alone. Then
      we will take her back with us; we must wait at least six months." Then,
      too late, poor George realized that he had spoken the fatal phrase again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If only you hadn't put off our marriage, she would be able to walk now,"
      said Henriette.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose suddenly. "Come," he said, "didn't you say you had to dress and
      pay some calls?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Henriette laughed, but took the hint.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Run along, little wife," he said. "I have a lot of work to do in the
      meantime. You won't be down-stairs before I shall have my nose buried in
      my papers. Bye-bye."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bye-bye," said Henriette. But they paused to exchange a dozen or so
      kisses before she went away to dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then George lighted a cigarette and stretched himself out in the big
      armchair. He seemed restless; he seemed to be disturbed about something.
      Could it be that he had not been so much at ease as he had pretended to
      be, since the letter had come from the baby's nurse? Madame Dupont had
      gone by the earliest train that morning. She had promised to telegraph at
      once&mdash;but she had not done so, and now it was late afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      George got up and wandered about. He looked at himself in the glass for a
      moment; then he went back to the chair and pulled up another to put his
      geet upon. He puffed away at his cigarette until he was calmer. But then
      suddenly he heard the rustle of a dress behind him, and glanced about, and
      started up with an exclamation, "Mother!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Dupont stood in the doorway. She did not speak. Her veil was thrown
      back and George noted instantly the look of agitation upon her
      countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter?" he cried. "We didn't get any telegram from you; we
      were not expecting you till tomorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Still his mother did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Henriette was just going out," he exclaimed nervously; "I had better call
      her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" said his mother quickly. Her voice was low and trembling. "I did not
      want Henriette to be here when I arrived."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what's the matter?" cried George.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again there was a silence before the reply came. He read something
      terrible in the mother's manner, and he found himself trembling violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have brought back the child and the nurse," said Madame Dupont.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! Is the little one sick?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter with her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing dangerous&mdash;for the moment, at least."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must send and get the doctor!" cried George.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have just come from the doctor's," was the reply. "He said it was
      necessary to take our child from the nurse and bring her up on the
      bottle."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again there was a pause. George could hardly bring himself to ask the next
      question. Try as he would, he could not keep his voice from weakening.
      "Well, now, what is her trouble?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother did not answer. She stood staring before her. At last she said,
      faintly, "I don't know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You didn't ask?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I asked. But it was not to our own doctor that I went."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" whispered George. For nearly a minute neither one of them spoke.
      "Why?" he inquired at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because&mdash;he&mdash;the nurse's doctor&mdash;had frightened me so&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Truly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. It is a disease&mdash;" again she stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      George cried, in a voice of agony, "and then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I asked him if the matter was so grave that I could not be satisfied
      with our ordinary doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what did he answer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He said that if we had the means it would really be better to consult a
      specialist."
    </p>
    <p>
      George looked at his mother again. He was able to do it, because she was
      not looking at him. He clenched his hands and got himself together. "And&mdash;where
      did he send you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother fumbled in her hand bag and drew out a visiting card. "Here,"
      she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And George looked at the card. It was all he could do to keep himself from
      tottering. It was the card of the doctor whom he had first consulted about
      his trouble! The specialist in venereal diseases!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was all George could do to control his voice. "You&mdash;you went to
      see him?" he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said his mother. "You know him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," he answered. "Or&mdash;that is&mdash;I have met him, I think. I
      don't know." And then to himself, "My God!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence. "He is coming to talk to you," said the mother, at
      last.
    </p>
    <p>
      George was hardly able to speak. "Then he is very much disturbed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, but he wants to talk to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. When the doctor saw the nurse, he said, 'Madame, it is impossible
      for me to continue to attend this child unless I have had this very day a
      conversation with the father.' So I said 'Very well,' and he said he would
      come at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      George turned away, and put his hands to his forehead. "My poor little
      daughter!" he whispered to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said the mother, her voice breaking, "she is, indeed, a poor little
      daughter!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A silence fell; for what could words avail in such a situation? Hearing
      the door open, Madame Dupont started, for her nerves were all a-quiver
      with the strain she had been under. A servant came in and spoke to her,
      and she said to George, "It is the doctor. If you need me, I shall be in
      the next room."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her son stood trembling, as if he were waiting the approach of an
      executioner. The other came into the room without seeing him and he stood
      for a minute, clasping and unclasping his hands, almost overcome with
      emotion. Then he said, "Good-day, doctor." As the man stared at him,
      surprised and puzzled, he added, "You don't recognize me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor looked again, more closely. George was expecting him to break
      out in rage; but instead his voice fell low. "You!" he exclaimed. "It is
      you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, in a voice of discouragement than of anger, he went on, "You got
      married, and you have a child! After all that I told you! You are a
      wretch!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," cried George, "let me explain to you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a word!" exclaimed the other. "There can be no explanation for what
      you have done."
    </p>
    <p>
      A silence followed. The young man did not know what to say. Finally,
      stretching out his arms, he pleaded, "You will take care of my little
      daughter all the same, will you not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The other turned away with disgust. "Imbecile!" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      George did not hear the word. "I was able to wait only six months," he
      murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor answered in a voice of cold self-repression, "That is enough,
      sir! All that does not concern me. I have done wrong even to let you see
      my indignation. I should have left you to judge yourself. I have nothing
      to do here but with the present and with the future&mdash;with the infant
      and with the nurse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She isn't in danger?" cried George.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The nurse is in danger of being contaminated."
    </p>
    <p>
      But George had not been thinking about the nurse. "I mean my child," he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just at present the symptoms are not disturbing."
    </p>
    <p>
      George waited; after a while he began, "You were saying about the nurse.
      Will you consent that I call my mother? She knows better than I."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you wish," was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man started to the door, but came back, in terrible distress. "I
      have one prayer to offer you sir; arrange it so that my wife&mdash;so that
      no one will know. If my wife learned that it is I who am the cause&mdash;!
      It is for her that I implore you! She&mdash;she isn't to blame."
    </p>
    <p>
      Said the doctor: "I will do everything in my power that she may be kept
      ignorant of the true nature of the disease."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, how I thank you!" murmured George. "How I thank you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not thank me; it is for her, and not for you, that I will consent to
      lie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And my mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your mother knows the truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I pray you, sir&mdash;we have enough to talk about, and very serious
      matters."
    </p>
    <p>
      So George went to the door and called his mother. She entered and greeted
      the doctor, holding herself erect, and striving to keep the signs of grief
      and terror from her face. She signed to the doctor to take a seat, and
      then seated herself by a little table near him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame Dupont," he began, "I have prescribed a course of treatment for
      the child. I hope to be able to improve its condition, and to prevent any
      new developments. But my duty and yours does not stop there; if there is
      still time, it is necessary to protect the health of the nurse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell us what it is necessary to do, Doctor?" said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The woman must stop nursing the child."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean we have to change the nurse?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame, the child can no longer be brought up at the breast, either by
      that nurse or by any other nurse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because the child would give her disease to the woman who gave her milk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Doctor, if we put her on the bottle&mdash;our little one&mdash;she
      will die!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly George burst out into sobs. "Oh, my poor little daughter! My
      God, my God!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Said the doctor, "If the feeding is well attended to, with sterilized milk&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That can do very well for healthy infants," broke in Madame Dupont. "But
      at the age of three months one cannot take from the breast a baby like
      ours, frail and ill. More than any other such an infant has need of a
      nurse&mdash;is that not true?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," the doctor admitted, "that is true. But&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case, between the life of the child, and the health of the nurse,
      you understand perfectly well that my choice is made."
    </p>
    <p>
      Between her words the doctor heard the sobbing of George, whose head was
      buried in his arms. "Madame," he said, "your love for that baby has just
      caused you to utter something ferocious! It is not for you to choose. It
      is not for you to choose. I forbid the nursing. The health of that woman
      does not belong to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," cried the grandmother, wildly, "nor does the health of out child
      belong to you! If there is a hope of saving it, that hope is in giving it
      more care than any other child; and you would wish that I put it upon a
      mode of nourishment which the doctors condemn, even for vigorous infants!
      You expect that I will let myself be taken in like that? I answer you: she
      shall have the milk which she needs, my poor little one! If there was a
      single thing that one could do to save her&mdash;I should be a criminal to
      neglect it!" And Madame Dupont broke out, with furious scorn, "The nurse!
      The nurse! We shall know how to do our duty&mdash;we shall take care of
      her, repay her. But our child before all! No sir, no! Everything that can
      be done to save our baby I shall do, let it cost what it will. To do what
      you say&mdash;you don't realize it&mdash;it would be as if I should kill
      the child!" In the end the agonized woman burst into tears. "Oh, my poor
      little angel! My little savior!"
    </p>
    <p>
      George had never ceased sobbing while his mother spoke; at these last
      words his sobs became loud cries. He struck the floor with his foot, he
      tore his hair, as if he were suffering from violent physical pain. "Oh,
      oh, oh!" he cried. "My little child! My little child!" And then, in a
      horrified whisper to himself, "I am a wretch! A criminal!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame," said the doctor, "you must calm yourself; you must both calm
      yourselves. You will not help out the situation by lamentations. You must
      learn to take it with calmness."
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Dupont set her lips together, and with a painful effort recovered
      her self-control. "You are right, sir," she said, in a low voice. "I ask
      your pardon; but if you only knew what that child means to me! I lost one
      at that age. I am an old woman, I am a widow&mdash;I had hardly hoped to
      live long enough to be a grandmother. But, as you say&mdash;we must be
      calm." She turned to the young man, "Calm yourself, my son. It is a poor
      way to show our love for the child, to abandon ourselves to tears. Let us
      talk, Doctor, and seriously&mdash;coldly. But I declare to you that
      nothing will ever induce me to put the child on the bottle, when I know
      that it might kill her. That is all I can say."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor replied: "This isn't the first time that I find myself in the
      present situation. Madame, I declare to you that always&mdash;ALWAYS, you
      understand&mdash;persons who have rejected my advice have had reason to
      repent it cruelly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The only thing of which I should repent&mdash;" began the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You simply do not know," interrupted the doctor, "what such a nurse is
      capable of. You cannot imagine what bitterness&mdash;legitimate
      bitterness, you understand&mdash;joined to the rapacity, the cupidity, the
      mischief-making impulse&mdash;might inspire these people to do. For them
      the BOURGEOIS is always somewhat of an enemy; and when they find
      themselves in position to avenge their inferiority, they are ferocious."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what could the woman do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What could she do? She could bring legal proceedings against you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But she is much too stupid to have that idea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Others will put it into her mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is too poor to pay the preliminary expenses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And do you propose then to profit by her ignorance and stupidity?
      Besides, she could obtain judicial assistance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, surely," exclaimed Madame Dupont, "such a thing was never heard of!
      Do you mean that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know a dozen prosecutions of that sort; and always when there has been
      certainty, the parents have lost their case."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But surely, Doctor, you must be mistaken! Not in a case like ours&mdash;not
      when it is a question of saving the life of a poor little innocent!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oftentimes exactly such facts have been presented."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here George broke in. "I can give you the dates of the decisions." He rose
      from his chair, glad of an opportunity to be useful. "I have the books,"
      he said, and took one from the case and brought it to the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All of that is no use&mdash;" interposed the mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the doctor said to George, "You will be able to convince yourself. The
      parents have been forced once or twice to pay the nurse a regular income,
      and at other times they have had to pay her an indemnity, of which the
      figure has varied between three and eight thousand francs."
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Dupont was ready with a reply to this. "Never fear, sir! If there
      should be a suit, we should have a good lawyer. We shall be able to pay
      and choose the best&mdash;and he would demand, without doubt, which of the
      two, the nurse or the child, has given the disease to the other."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor was staring at her in horror. "Do you not perceive that would
      be a monstrous thing to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I would not have to say it," was the reply. "The lawyer would see to
      it&mdash;is not that his profession? My point is this: by one means or
      another he would make us win our case."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the scandal that would result," replied the other. "Have you thought
      of that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here George, who had been looking over his law-books, broke in. "Doctor,
      permit me to give you a little information. In cases of this sort, the
      names are never printed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but they are spoken at the hearings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's true."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And are you certain that there will not be any newspaper to print the
      judgment?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What won't they stoop to," exclaimed Madame Dupont&mdash;"those filthy
      journals!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said the other, "and see what a scandal? What a shame it would be to
      you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The doctor is right, mother," exclaimed the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Madame Dupont was not yet convinced. "We will prevent the woman from
      taking any steps; we will give her what she demands from us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But then," said the other, "you will give yourselves up to the risk of
      blackmail. I know a family which has been thus held up for over twelve
      years."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you will permit me, Doctor," said George, timidly, "she could be made
      to sign a receipt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For payment in full?" asked the doctor, scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Even so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then," added his mother, "she would be more than delighted to go back
      to her country with a full purse. She would be able to buy a little house
      and a bit of ground&mdash;in that country one doesn't need so much in
      order to live."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment there was a tap upon the door, and the nurse entered. She
      was a country woman, robust, rosy-cheeked, fairly bursting with health.
      When she spoke one got the impression that her voice was more than she
      could contain. It did not belong in a drawing-room, but under the open sky
      of her country home. "Sir," she said, addressing the doctor, "the baby is
      awake."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will go and see her," was the reply; and then to Madame Dupont, "We
      will take up this conversation later on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," said the mother. "Will you have need of the nurse?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Madame," the doctor answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nurse," said the mother, "sit down and rest. Wait a minute, I wish to
      speak to you." As the doctor went out, she took her son to one side and
      whispered to him, "I know the way to arrange everything. If we let her
      know what is the matter, and if she accepts, the doctor will have nothing
      more to say. Isn't that so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Obviously," replied the son.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going to promise that we will give her two thousand francs when she
      goes away, if she will consent to continue nursing the child."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two thousand francs?" said the other. "Is that enough?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will see," was the reply. "If she hesitates, I will go further. Let me
      attend to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      George nodded his assent, and Madame Dupont returned to the nurse. "You
      know," she said, "that our child is a little sick?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The other looked at her in surprise. "Why no, ma'am!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said the grandmother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, ma'am, I have taken the best of care of her; I have always kept her
      proper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not saying anything to the contrary," said Madame Dupont, "but the
      child is sick, the doctors have said it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The nurse was not to be persuaded; she thought they were getting ready to
      scold her. "Humph," she said, "that's a fine thing&mdash;the doctors! If
      they couldn't always find something wrong you'd say they didn't know their
      business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But our doctor is a great doctor; and you have seen yourself that our
      child has some little pimples."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, ma'am," said the nurse, "that's the heat&mdash;it's nothing but the
      heat of the blood breaking out. You don't need to bother yourself; I tell
      you it's only the child's blood. It's not my fault; I swear to you that
      she had not lacked anything, and that I have always kept her proper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not reproaching you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is there to reproach me for? Oh, what bad luck! She's tiny&mdash;the
      little one&mdash;she's a bit feeble; but Lord save us, she's a city child!
      And she's getting along all right, I tell you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," persisted Madame Dupont, "I tell you&mdash;she has got a cold in her
      head, and she has an eruption at the back of the throat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," cried the nurse, angrily, "if she has, it's because the doctor
      scratched her with that spoon he put into her mouth wrong end first! A
      cold in the head? Yes, that's true; but if she has caught cold, I can't
      say when, I don't know anything about it&mdash;nothing, nothing at all. I
      have always kept her well covered; she's always had as much as three
      covers on her. The truth is, it was when you came, the time before last;
      you were all the time insisting upon opening the windows in the house!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But once more I tell you," cried Madame Dupont, "we are not putting any
      blame on you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," cried the woman, more vehemently. "I know what that kind of talk
      means. It's no use&mdash;when you're a poor country woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you imagining now?" demanded the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that's all right. It's no use when you're a poor country woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I repeat to you once more," cried Madame Dupont, with difficulty
      controlling her impatience, "we have nothing whatever to blame you for."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the nurse began to weep. "If I had known that anything like this was
      coming to me&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have nothing to blame you for," declared the other. "We only wish to
      warn you that you might possibly catch the disease of the child."
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman pouted. "A cold in the head!" she exclaimed. "Well, if I catch
      it, it won't be the first time. I know how to blow my nose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you might also get the pimples."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this the nurse burst into laughter so loud that the bric-a-brac
      rattled. "Oh, oh, oh! Dear lady, let me tell you, we ain't city folks, we
      ain't; we don't have such soft skins. What sort of talk is that? Pimples&mdash;what
      difference would that make to poor folks like us? We don't have a white
      complexion like the ladies of Paris. We are out all day in the fields, in
      the sun and the rain, instead of rubbing cold cream on our muzzles! No
      offense, ma'am&mdash;but I say if you're looking for an excuse to get rid
      of me, you must get a better one than that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse!" exclaimed the other. "What in the world do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I know!" said the nurse, nodding her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But speak!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's no use, when you're only a poor country woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't understand you! I swear to you that I don't understand you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," sneered the other, "I understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But then&mdash;explain yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I don't want to say it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you must; I wish it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go ahead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm only a poor country woman, but I am no more stupid than the others,
      for all that. I know perfectly well what your tricks mean. Mr. George here
      has been grumbling because you promised me thirty francs more a month, if
      I came to Paris." And then, turning upon the other, she went on&mdash;"But,
      sir, isn't it only natural? Don't I have to put my own child away
      somewheres else? And then, can my husband live on his appetite? We're
      nothing but poor country people, we are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are making a mistake, nurse," broke in George. "It is nothing at all
      of that sort; mother is quite right. I am so far from wanting to reproach
      you, that, on the contrary, I think she had not promised enough, and I
      want to make you, for my part, another promise. When you go away, when
      baby is old enough to be weaned, by way of thanking you, we wish to give
      you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Dupont broke in, hurriedly, "We wish to give you,&mdash;over and
      above your wages, you understand&mdash;we wish to give you five hundred
      francs, and perhaps a thousand, if the little one is altogether in good
      health. You understand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The nurse stared at her, stupefied. "You will give me five hundred francs&mdash;for
      myself?" She sought to comprehend the words. "But that was not agreed, you
      don't have to do that at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," admitted Madame Dupont.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But then," whispered the nurse, half to herself, "that's not natural."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," the other hurried on, "it is because the baby will have need of
      extra care. You will have to take more trouble; you will have to give it
      medicines; your task will be a little more delicate, a little more
      difficult."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes; then it's so that I will be sure to take care of her? I
      understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it's agreed?" exclaimed Madame Dupont, with relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes ma'am," said the nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you won't come later on to make reproaches to us? We understand one
      another clearly? We have warned you that the child is sick and that you
      could catch the disease. Because of that, because of the special need of
      care which she has, we promise you five hundred francs at the end of the
      nursing. That's all right, is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, my lady," cried the nurse, all her cupidity awakened, "you spoke
      just now of a thousand francs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, then, a thousand francs."
    </p>
    <p>
      George passed behind the nurse and got his mother by the arm, drawing her
      to one side. "It would be a mistake," he whispered, "if we did not make
      her sign an agreement to all that."
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother turned to the nurse. "In order that there may be no
      misunderstanding about the sum&mdash;you see how it is, I had forgotten
      already that I had spoken of a thousand francs&mdash;we will draw up a
      little paper, and you, on your part, will write one for us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good, ma'am," said the nurse, delighted with the idea of so
      important a transaction. "Why, it's just as you do when you rent a house!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here comes the doctor," said the other. "Come, nurse, it is agreed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, ma'am," was the answer. But all the same, as she went out she
      hesitated and looked sharply first at the doctor, and then at George and
      his mother. She suspected that something was wrong, and she meant to find
      out if she could.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor seated himself in George's office chair, as if to write a
      prescription. "The child's condition remains the same," he said; "nothing
      disturbing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doctor," said Madame Dupont, gravely, "from now on, you will be able to
      devote your attention to the baby and the nurse without any scruple.
      During your absence we have arranged matters nicely. The nurse has been
      informed about the situation, and she does not mind. She has agreed to
      accept an indemnity, and the amount has been stated."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the doctor did not take these tidings as the other had hoped he might.
      He replied: "The malady which the nurse will almost inevitably contract in
      feeding the child is too grave in its consequences. Such consequences
      might go as far as complete helplessness, even as far as death. So I say
      that the indemnity, whatever it might be, would not pay the damage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," exclaimed the other, "she accepts it! She is mistress of herself,
      and she has the right&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not at all certain that she has the right to sell her own health.
      And I am certain that she has not the right to sell the health of her
      husband and her children. If she becomes infected, it is nearly certain
      that she will communicate the disease to them; the health and the life of
      the children she might have later on would be greatly compromised. Such
      things she cannot possibly sell. Come, madame, you must see that a bargain
      of this sort isn't possible. If the evil has not been done, you must do
      everything to avoid it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," protested the mother, wildly, "you do not defend our interests!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame," was the reply, "I defend those who are weakest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If we had called in our own physician, who knows us," she protested, "he
      would have taken sides with us."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor rose, with a severe look on his face. "I doubt it," he said,
      "but there is still time to call him."
    </p>
    <p>
      George broke in with a cry of distress. "Sir, I implore you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And the mother in turn cried. "Don't abandon us, sir! You ought to make
      allowances! If you knew what that child is to me! I tell you it seems to
      me as if I had waited for her coming in order to die. Have pity upon us!
      Have pity upon her! You speak of the weakest&mdash;it is not she who is
      the weakest? You have seen her, you have seen that poor little baby, so
      emaciated! You have seen what a heap of suffering she is already; and
      cannot that inspire in you any sympathy? I pray you, sir&mdash;I pray
      you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I pity her," said the doctor, "I would like to save her&mdash;and I will
      do everything for her. But do not ask me to sacrifice to a feeble infant,
      with an uncertain and probably unhappy life, the health of a sound and
      robust woman. It is useless for us to continue such a discussion as that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon Madame Dupont leaped up in sudden frenzy. "Very Well!" she
      exclaimed. "I will not follow your counsels, I will not listen to you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Said the doctor in a solemn voice: "There is already some one here who
      regrets that he did not listen to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," moaned George, "to my misfortune, to the misfortune of all of us."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Madame Dupont was quite beside herself. "Very well!" she cried. "If it
      is a fault, if it is a crime, if I shall have to suffer remorse for it in
      this life, and all the punishments in the life to come&mdash;I accept it
      all for myself alone! Myself alone, I take that responsibility! It is
      frightfully heavy, but I accept it. I am profoundly a Christian sir; I
      believe in eternal damnation; but to save my little child I consent to
      lose my soul forever. Yes, my mind is made up&mdash;I will do everything
      to save that life! Let God judge me; and if he condemns me, so much the
      worse for me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor answered: "That responsibility is one which I cannot let you
      take, for it will be necessary that I should accept my part, and I refuse
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What will you do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall warn the nurse. I shall inform her exactly, completely&mdash;something
      which you have not done, I feel sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" cried Madame Dupont, wildly. "You, a doctor, called into a family
      which gives you its entire confidence, which hands over to you its most
      terrible secrets, its most horrible miseries&mdash;you would betray them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not a betrayal," replied the man, sternly. "It is something which
      the law commands; and even if the law were silent, I would not permit a
      family of worthy people to go astray so far as to commit a crime. Either I
      give up the case, or you have the nursing of the child stopped."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You threaten! You threaten!" cried the woman, almost frantic. "You abuse
      the power which your knowledge gives you! You know that it is you whose
      attention we need by that little cradle; you know that we believe in you,
      and you threaten to abandon us! Your abandonment means the death of the
      child, perhaps! And if I listen to you, if we stop the nursing of the
      child&mdash;that also means her death!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She flung up her hands like a mad creature. "And yet there is no other
      means! Ah, my God! Why do you not let it be possible for me to sacrifice
      myself? I would wish nothing more than to be able to do it&mdash;if only
      you might take my old body, my old flesh, my old bones&mdash;if only I
      might serve for something! How quickly would I consent that it should
      infect me&mdash;this atrocious malady! How I would offer myself to it&mdash;with
      what joys, with what delights&mdash;however disgusting, however frightful
      it might be, however much to be dreaded! Yes, I would take it without
      fear, without regret, if my poor old empty breasts might still give to the
      child the milk which would preserve its life!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped; and George sprang suddenly from his seat, and fled to her and
      flung himself down upon his knees before her, mingling his sobs and tears
      with hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor rose and moved about the room, unable any longer to control his
      distress. "Oh, the poor people!" he murmured to himself. "The poor, poor
      people!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The storm passed, and Madame Dupont, who was a woman of strong character,
      got herself together. Facing the doctor again, she said, "Come, sir, tell
      us what we have to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must stop the nursing, and keep the woman here as a dry nurse, in
      order that she may not go away to carry the disease elsewhere. Do not
      exaggerate to yourself the danger which will result to the child. I am, in
      truth, extremely moved by your suffering, and I will do everything&mdash;I
      swear it to you&mdash;that your baby may recover as quickly as possible
      its perfect health. I hope to succeed, and that soon. And now I must leave
      you until tomorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Doctor, thank you," said Madame Dupont, faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man rose and accompanied the doctor to the door. He could not
      bring himself to speak, but stood hanging his head until the other was
      gone. Then he came to his mother. He sought to embrace her, but she
      repelled him&mdash;without violence, but firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her son stepped back and put his hands over his face. "Forgive me!" he
      said, in a broken voice. "Are we not unhappy enough, without hating each
      other?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother answered: "God has punished you for your debauch by striking at
      your child."
    </p>
    <p>
      But, grief-stricken as the young man was, he could not believe that.
      "Impossible!" he said. "There is not even a man sufficiently wicked or
      unjust to commit the act which you attribute to your God!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said his mother, sadly, "you believe in nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe in no such God as that," he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      A silence followed. When it was broken, it was by the entrance of the
      nurse. She had opened the door of the room and had been standing there for
      some moments, unheeded. Finally she stepped forward. "Madame," she said,
      "I have thought it over; I would rather go back to my home at once, and
      have only the five hundred francs."
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Dupont stared at her in consternation. "What is that you are
      saying? You want to return to your home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, ma'am," was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," cried George, "only ten minutes ago you were not thinking of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What has happened since then?" demanded Madame Dupont.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have thought it over."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thought it over?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I am getting lonesome for my little one and for my husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the last ten minutes?" exclaimed George.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There must be something else," his mother added. "Evidently there must be
      something else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" insisted the nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I say yes!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'm afraid the air of Paris might not be good for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had better wait and try it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would rather go back at once to my home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, now," cried Madame Dupont, "tell us why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have told you. I have thought it over."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thought what over?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I have thought."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," cried the mother, "what a stupid reply! 'I have thought it over! I
      have thought it over!' Thought WHAT over, I want to know!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, everything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you know how to tell us what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you, everything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why," exclaimed Madame Dupont, "you are an imbecile!"
    </p>
    <p>
      George stepped between his mother and the nurse. "Let me talk to her," he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman came back to her old formula: "I know that we're only poor
      country people."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen to me, nurse," said the young man. "Only a little while ago you
      were afraid that we would send you away. You were satisfied with the wages
      which my mother had fixed. In addition to those wages we had promised you
      a good sum when you returned to your home. Now you tell us that you want
      to go away. You see? All at once. There must be some reason; let us
      understand it. There must certainly be a reason. Has anybody done anything
      to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir," said the woman, dropping her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have thought it over."
    </p>
    <p>
      George burst out, "Don't go on repeating always the same thing&mdash;'I
      have thought it over!' That's not telling us anything." Controlling
      himself, he added, gently, "Come, tell me why you want to go away?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence. "Well?" he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you, I have thought&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      George exclaimed in despair, "It's as if one were talking to a block of
      wood!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother took up the conversation again. "You must realize, you have not
      the right to go away."
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman answered, "I WANT to go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I will not let you leave us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," interrupted George angrily, "let her go; we cannot fasten her here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, then," cried the exasperated mother, "since you want to go,
      go! But I have certainly the right to say to you that you are as stupid as
      the animals on your farm!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't say that I am not," answered the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not pay you the month which has just begun, and you will pay your
      railroad fare for yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      The other drew back with a look of anger. "Oho!" she cried. "We'll see
      about that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, we'll see about it!" cried George. "And you will get out of here at
      once. Take yourself off&mdash;I will have no more to do with you. Good
      evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, George," protested his mother, "don't lose control of yourself." And
      then, with a great effort at calmness, "That cannot be serious, nurse!
      Answer me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would rather go off right away to my home, and only have my five
      hundred francs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "WHAT?" cried George, in consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that you are telling me?" exclaimed Madame Dupont.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Five hundred francs?" repeated her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What five hundred francs?" echoed the mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The five hundred francs you promised me," said the nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have promised you five hundred francs? WE?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When the child should be weaned, and if we should be satisfied with you!
      That was our promise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. You said you would give them to me when I was leaving. Now I am
      leaving, and I want them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Dupont drew herself up, haughtily. "In the first place," she said,
      "kindly oblige me by speaking to me in another tone; do you understand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman answered, "You have nothing to do but give me my money, and I
      will say nothing more."
    </p>
    <p>
      George went almost beside himself with rage at this. "Oh, it's like that?"
      he shouted. "Very well; I'll show you!" And he sprang to the door and
      opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the nurse never budged. "Give me my five hundred francs!" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      George seized her by the arm and shoved her toward the door. "You clear
      out of here, do you understand me? And as quickly as you can!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman shook her arm loose, and sneered into his face. "Come now, you&mdash;you
      can talk to me a little more politely, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you go?" shouted George, completely beside himself. "Will you go, or
      must I go out and look for a policeman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A policeman!" demanded the woman. "For what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To put you outside! You are behaving yourself like a thief."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A thief? I? What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean that you are demanding money which doesn't belong to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "More than that," broke in Madame Dupont, "you are destroying that poor
      little baby! You are a wicked woman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will put you out myself!" shouted George, and seized her by the arm
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it's like that, is it?" retorted the nurse. "Then you really want me
      to tell you why I am going away?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, tell me!" cried he.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother added, "Yes, yes!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She would have spoken differently had she chanced to look behind her and
      seen Henriette, who at that moment appeared in the doorway. She had been
      about to go out, when her attention had been caught by the loud voices.
      She stood now, amazed, clasping her hands together, while the nurse,
      shaking her fist first at Madame Dupont and then at her son, cried loudly,
      "Very well! I'm going away because I don't want to catch a filthy disease
      here!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "HUSH!" cried Madame Dupont, and sprang toward her, her hands clenched as
      if she would choke her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be silent!" cried George, wild with terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the woman rushed on without dropping her voice, "Oh, you need not be
      troubling yourselves for fear anyone should overhear! All the world knows
      it! Your other servants were listening with me at your door! They heard
      every word your doctor said!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shut up!" screamed George.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother seized the woman fiercely by the arm. "Hold your tongue!" she
      hissed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But again the other shook herself loose. She was powerful, and now her
      rage was not to be controlled. She waved her hands in the air, shouting,
      "Let me be, let me be! I know all about your brat&mdash;that you will
      never be able to raise it&mdash;that it's rotten because it's father has a
      filthy disease he got from a woman of the street!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She got no farther. She was interrupted by a frenzied shriek from
      Henriette. The three turned, horrified, just in time to see her fall
      forward upon the floor, convulsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My God!" cried George. He sprang toward her, and tried to lift her, but
      she shrank from him, repelling him with a gesture of disgust, of hatred,
      of the most profound terror. "Don't touch me!" she screamed, like a
      maniac. "Don't touch me!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was in vain that Madame Dupont sought to control her daughter-in-law.
      Henriette was beside herself, frantic, she could not be brought to listen
      to any one. She rushed into the other room, and when the older woman
      followed her, shrieked out to be left alone. Afterwards, she fled to her
      own room and barred herself in, and George and his mother waited
      distractedly for hours until she should give some sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would she kill herself, perhaps? Madame Dupont hovered on guard about the
      door of the nursery for fear that the mother in her fit of insanity might
      attempt some harm to her child.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nurse had slunk away abashed when she saw the consequences of her
      outburst. By the time she had got her belongings packed, she had recovered
      her assurance. She wanted her five hundred; also she wanted her wages and
      her railroad fare home. She wanted them at once, and she would not leave
      until she got them. George and his mother, in the midst of all their
      anguish of mind, had to go through a disgusting scene with this coarse and
      angry woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had no such sum of money in the house, and the nurse refused to
      accept a check. She knew nothing about a check. It was so much paper, and
      might be some trick that they were playing on her. She kept repeating her
      old formula, "I am nothing but a poor country woman." Nor would she be
      contented with the promise that she would receive the money the next day.
      She seemed to be afraid that if she left the house she would be
      surrendering her claim. So at last the distracted George to sally forth
      and obtain the cash from some tradesmen in the neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman took her departure. They made her sign a receipt in full for all
      claims and they strove to persuade themselves that this made them safe;
      but in their hearts they had no real conviction of safety. What was the
      woman's signature, or her pledged word, against the cupidity of her
      husband and relatives. Always she would have the dreadful secret to hold
      over them, and so they would live under the shadow of possible blackmail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later in the day Henriette sent for her mother-in-law. She was white, her
      eyes were swollen with weeping, and she spoke in a voice choked with sobs.
      She wished to return at once to her father's home, and to take little
      Gervaise with her. Madame Dupont cried out in horror at this proposition,
      and argued and pleaded and wept&mdash;but all to no purpose. The girl was
      immovable. She would not stay under her husband's roof, and she would take
      her child with her. It was her right, and no one could refuse her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The infant had been crying for hours, but that made no difference.
      Henriette insisted that a cab should be called at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she went back to the home of Monsieur Loches and told him the hideous
      story. Never before in her life had she discussed such subjects with any
      one, but now in her agitation she told her father all. As George had
      declared to the doctor, Monsieur Loches was a person of violent temper; at
      this revelation, at the sight of his daughter's agony, he was almost
      beside himself. His face turned purple, the veins stood out on his
      forehead; a trembling seized him. He declared that he would kill George&mdash;there
      was nothing else to do. Such a scoundrel should not be permitted to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effort which Henriette had to make to restrain him had a calming
      effect upon herself. Bitter and indignant as she was, she did not want
      George to be killed. She clung to her father, beseeching him to promise
      her that he would not do such a thing; and all that day and evening she
      watched him, unwilling to let him out of her sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a matter which claimed her immediate attention, and which helped
      to withdraw them from the contemplation of their own sufferings. The
      infant must be fed and cared for&mdash;the unhappy victim of other
      people's sins, whose life was now imperiled. A dry nurse must be found at
      once, a nurse competent to take every precaution and give the child every
      chance. This nurse must be informed of the nature of the trouble&mdash;another
      matter which required a great deal of anxious thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening came Madame Dupont, tormented by anxiety about the child's
      welfare, and beseeching permission to help take care of it. It was
      impossible to refuse such a request. Henriette could not endure to see
      her, but the poor grandmother would come and sit for hours in the nursery,
      watching the child and the nurse, in silent agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      This continued for days, while poor George wandered about at home,
      suffering such torment of mind as can hardly be imagined. Truly, in these
      days he paid for his sins; he paid a thousand-fold in agonized and
      impotent regret. He looked back upon the course of his life, and traced
      one by one the acts which had led him and those he loved into this
      nightmare of torment. He would have been willing to give his life if he
      could have undone those acts. But avenging nature offered him no such easy
      deliverance as that. We shudder as we read the grim words of the Jehovah
      of the ancient Hebrews; and yet not all the learning of modern times has
      availed to deliver us from the cruel decree, that the sins of the fathers
      shall be visited upon the children.
    </p>
    <p>
      George wrote notes to his wife, imploring her forgiveness. He poured out
      all his agony and shame to her, begging her to see him just once, to give
      him a chance to plead his defense. It was not much of a defense, to be
      sure; it was only that he had done no worse than the others did&mdash;only
      that he was a wretched victim of ignorance. But he loved her, he had
      proven that he loved her, and he pleaded that for the sake of their child
      she would forgive him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When all this availed nothing, he went to see the doctor, whose advice he
      had so shamefully neglected. He besought this man to intercede for him&mdash;which
      the doctor, of course, refused to do. It was an extra-medical matter, he
      said, and George was absurd to expect him to meddle in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as a matter of fact, the doctor had already been interceding&mdash;he
      had gone farther in pleading George's cause than he was willing to have
      George know. For Monsieur Loches had paid him a visit&mdash;his purpose
      being to ask the doctor to continue attendance upon the infant, and also
      to give Henriette a certificate which she could use in her suit for a
      divorce from her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      So inevitably there had been a discussion of the whole question between
      the two men. The doctor had granted the first request, but refused the
      second. In the first place, he said, there was a rule of professional
      secrecy which would prevent him. And when the father-in-law requested to
      know if the rule of professional secrecy compelled him to protect a
      criminal against honest people, the doctor answered that even if his
      ethics permitted it, he would still refuse the request. "I would reproach
      myself forever," he said, "if I had aided you to obtain such a divorce."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then," cried the old man, vehemently, "because you profess such and such
      theories, because the exercise of your profession makes you the constant
      witness of such miseries&mdash;therefore it is necessary that my daughter
      should continue to bear that man's name all her life!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor answered, gently, "Sir, I understand and respect your grief.
      But believe me, you are not in a state of mind to decide about these
      matters now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are mistaken," declared the other, controlling himself with an
      effort. "I have been thinking about nothing else for days. I have
      discussed it with my daughter, and she agrees with me. Surely, sir, you
      cannot desire that my daughter should continue to live with a man who has
      struck her so brutal, so cowardly, a blow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I refuse your request," the doctor answered, "it is in the interest of
      your daughter." Then, seeing the other's excitement returning, he
      continued, "In your state of mind, Monsieur Loches, I know that you will
      probably be abusing me before five minutes has passed. But that will not
      trouble me. I have seen many cases. And since I have made the mistake of
      letting myself be trapped into this discussion, I must explain to you the
      reason for my attitude. You ask of me a certificate so that you may prove
      in court that your son-in-law is afflicted with syphilis."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precisely," said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And have you not reflected upon this&mdash;that at the same time you will
      be publicly attesting that your daughter has been exposed to the
      contagion? With such an admission, an admission officially registered in
      the public records, do you believe that she will find it easy to re-marry
      later on?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She will never re-marry," said the father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She says that today, but can you affirm that she will say the same thing
      five years from now, ten years from now? I tell you you will not obtain
      that divorce, because I will most certainly refuse you the necessary
      certificate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then," cried the other, "I will find other means of establishing proofs.
      I will have the child examined by another doctor!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The other answered. "Then you do not find that that poor little one has
      been already sufficiently handicapped at the outset of its life? Your
      granddaughter has a physical defect. Do you wish to add to that a
      certificate of hereditary syphilis, which will follow her all her life?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Loches sprang from his chair. "You mean that if the victims seek
      to defend themselves, they will be struck the harder! You mean that the
      law gives me no weapon against a man who, knowing his condition, takes a
      young girl, sound, trusting, innocent, and befouls her with the result of
      his debauches&mdash;makes her the mother of a poor little creature, whose
      future is such that those who love her the most do not know whether they
      ought to pray for her life, or for her immediate deliverance? Sir," he
      continued, in his orator's voice, "that man has inflicted upon the woman
      he has married a supreme insult. He has made her the victim of the most
      odious assault. He has degraded her&mdash;he has brought her, so to speak,
      into contact with the woman of the streets. He has created between her and
      that common woman I know not what mysterious relationship. It is the
      poisoned blood of the prostitute which poisons my daughter and her child;
      that abject creature, she lives, she lives in us! She belongs to our
      family&mdash;he has given her a seat at our hearth! He has soiled the
      imagination and the thoughts of my poor child, as he has soiled her body.
      He has united forever in her soul the idea of love which she has placed so
      high, with I know not what horrors of the hospitals. He has tainted her in
      her dignity and her modesty, in her love as well as in her baby. He has
      struck her down with physical and moral decay, he has overwhelmed her with
      vileness. And yet the law is such, the customs of society are such, that
      the woman cannot separate herself from that man save by the aid of legal
      proceedings whose scandal will fall upon herself and upon her child!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Loches had been pacing up and down the room as he spoke, and now
      he clenched his fists in sudden fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well! I will not address myself to the law. Since I learned the
      truth I have been asking myself if it was not my duty to find that monster
      and to put a bullet into his head, as one does to a mad dog. I don't know
      what weakness, what cowardice, has held me back, and decided me to appeal
      to the law. Since the law will not protect me, I will seek justice for
      myself. Perhaps his death will be a good warning for the others!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor shrugged his shoulders, as if to say that this was no affair of
      his and that he would not try to interfere. But he remarked, quietly: "You
      will be tried for your life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be acquitted!" cried the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but after a public revelation of all your miseries. You will make
      the scandal greater, the miseries greater&mdash;that is all. And how do
      you know but that on the morrow of your acquittal, you will find yourself
      confronting another court, a higher and more severe one? How do you know
      but that your daughter, seized at last by pity for the man you have
      killed, will not demand to know by what right you have acted so, by what
      right you have made an orphan of her child? How can you know but that her
      child also may some day demand an accounting of you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Loches let his hands fall, and stood, a picture of crushed
      despair. "Tell me then," he said, in a faint voice, "what ought I to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgive!"
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while the doctor sat looking at him. "Sir," he said, at last, "tell
      me one thing. You are inflexible; you feel you have the right to be
      inflexible. But are you really so certain that it was not your duty, once
      upon a time, to save your daughter from the possibility of such
      misfortune?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" cried the other. "My duty? What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean this, sir. When that marriage was being discussed, you certainly
      took precautions to inform yourself about the financial condition of your
      future son-in-law. You demanded that he should prove to you that his
      stocks and bonds were actual value, listed on the exchange. Also, you
      obtained some information about his character. In fact, you forgot only
      one point, the most important of all&mdash;that was, to inquire if he was
      in good health. You never did that."
    </p>
    <p>
      The father-in-law's voice had become faint. "No," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because that is not the custom."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, but that ought to be the custom. Surely the father of a
      family, before he gives his daughter to a man, should take as much
      precaution as a business concern which accepts an employee."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right," was the reply, "there should be a law." The man spoke as
      a deputy, having authority in these matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the doctor cried, "No, no, sir! Do not make a new law. We have too
      many already. There is no need of it. It would suffice that people should
      know a little better what syphilis is. The custom would establish itself
      very quickly for a suitor to add to all the other documents which he
      presents, a certificate of a doctor, as proof that he could be received
      into a family without bringing a pestilence with him. That would be very
      simple. Once let the custom be established, then the suitor would go to
      the doctor for a certificate of health, just as he goes to the priest for
      a certificate that he has confessed; and by that means you would prevent a
      great deal of suffering in the world. Or let me put it another way, sir.
      Nowadays, before you conclude a marriage, you get the lawyers of the two
      families together. It would be of at least equal importance to get their
      two doctors together. You see, sir, your inquiry concerning your
      son-in-law was far from complete. So your daughter may fairly ask you, why
      you, being a man, being a father who ought to know these things, did not
      take as much care of her health as you took of her fortune. So it is, sir,
      that I say to you, forgive!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Monsieur Loches said again, "Never!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And again the doctor sat and watched him for a minute. "Come, sir," he
      began, finally, "since it is necessary to employ the last argument, I will
      do so. To be so severe and so pitiless&mdash;are you yourself without
      sin?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The other answered, "I have never had a shameful disease."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not ask you that," interrupted the doctor. "I ask you if you have
      never exposed yourself to the chance of having it." And then, reading the
      other's face, he went on, in a tone of quiet certainty. "Yes, you have
      exposed yourself. Then, sir, it was not virtue that you had; it was good
      fortune. That is one of the things which exasperate me the most&mdash;that
      term 'shameful disease' which you have just used. Like all other diseases,
      that is one of our misfortunes, and it is never shameful to be unfortunate&mdash;even
      if one has deserved it." The doctor paused, and then with some excitement
      he went on: "Come, sir, come, we must understand each other. Among men the
      most exacting, among those who with their middle-class prudery dare not
      pronounce the name of syphilis, or who make the most terrifying faces, the
      most disgusted, when they consent to speak of it&mdash;who regard the
      syphilitic as sinners&mdash;I should wish to know how many there are who
      have never exposed themselves to a similar misadventure. They and they
      alone have the right to speak. How many are there? Among a thousand men,
      are there four? Very well, then. Excepting those four, between all the
      rest and the syphilitic there is nothing but the difference of chance."
    </p>
    <p>
      There came into the doctor's voice at this moment a note of intense
      feeling; for these were matters of which evidence came to him every day.
      "I tell you, sir, that such people are deserving of sympathy, because they
      are suffering. If they have committed a fault, they have at least the plea
      that they are expiating it. No, sir, let me hear no more of that
      hypocrisy. Recall your own youth, sir. That which afflicts your
      son-in-law, you have deserved it just as much as he&mdash;more than he,
      perhaps. Therefore, have pity on him; have for him the toleration which
      the unpunished criminal ought to have for the criminal less fortunate than
      himself upon whom the penalty has fallen. Is that not so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Loches had been listening to this discourse with the feeling of a
      thief before the bar. There was nothing that he could answer. "Sir," he
      stammered, "as you present this thing to me&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But am I not right?" insisted the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you are," the other admitted. "But&mdash;I cannot say all that to
      my daughter, to persuade her to go back to her husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can give her other arguments," was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What arguments, in God's name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no lack of them. You will say to her that a separation would be
      a misfortune for all; that her husband is the only one in the world who
      would be devoted enough to help her save her child. You will say to her
      that out of the ruins of her first happiness she can build herself another
      structure, far stronger. And, sir, you will add to that whatever your good
      heart may suggest&mdash;and we will arrange so that the next child of the
      pair shall be sound and vigorous."
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Loches received this announcement with the same surprise that
      George himself had manifested. "Is that possible?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor cried: "Yes, yes, yes&mdash;a thousand times yes! There is a
      phrase which I repeat on every occasion, and which I would wish to post
      upon the walls. It is that syphilis is an imperious mistress, who only
      demands that one should recognize her power. She is terrible for those who
      think her insignificant, and gentle with those who know how dangerous she
      is. You know that kind of mistress&mdash;who is only vexed when she is
      neglected. You may tell this to your daughter&mdash;you will restore her
      to the arms of her husband, from whom she has no longer anything to fear,
      and I will guarantee that you will be a happy grandfather two years from
      now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Loches at last showed that he was weakened in his resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doctor," he said, "I do not know that I can ever go so far as
      forgiveness, but I promise you that I will do no irreparable act, and that
      I will not oppose a reconciliation if after the lapse of some time&mdash;I
      cannot venture to say how long&mdash;my poor child should make up her mind
      to a reconciliation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good," said the other. "But let me add this: If you have another
      daughter, take care to avoid the fault which you committed when you
      married off the first."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," said the old man, "I did not know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, surely!" cried the other. "You did not know! You are a father, and
      you did not know! You are a deputy, you have assumed the responsibility
      and the honor of making our laws&mdash;and you did not know! You are
      ignorant about syphilis, just as you probably are ignorant about
      alcoholism and tuberculosis."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," exclaimed the other, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," said the doctor, "I will leave you out, if you wish. I am
      talking of the others, the five hundred, and I don't know how many more,
      who are there in the Chamber of Deputies, and who call themselves
      representatives of the people. They are not able to find a single hour to
      discuss these three cruel gods, to which egotism and indifference make
      every day such frightful human sacrifices. They have not sufficient
      leisure to combat this ferocious trinity, which destroys every day
      thousands of lives. Alcoholism! It would be necessary to forbid the
      manufacture of poisons, and to restrict the number of licenses; but as one
      has fear of the great distillers, who are rich and powerful, and of the
      little dealers, who are the masters of universal suffrage, one puts one's
      conscience to sleep by lamenting the immorality of the working-class, and
      publishing little pamphlets and sermons. Imbeciles!...Tuberculosis!
      Everybody knows the true remedy, which would be the paying of sufficient
      wages, and the tearing down of the filthy tenements into which the
      laborers are packed&mdash;those who are the most useful and the most
      unfortunate among our population! But needless to say, no one wants that
      remedy, so we go round begging the workingmen not to spit on the
      sidewalks. Wonderful! But syphilis&mdash;why do you not occupy yourself
      with that? Why, since you have ministers whose duty it is to attend to all
      sorts of things, do you not have a minister to attend to the public
      health?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Doctor," responded Monsieur Loches, "you fall into the French
      habit of considering the government as the cause of all evils. Show us the
      way, you learned gentlemen! Since that is a matter about which you are
      informed, and we are ignorant, begin by telling us what measures you
      believe to be necessary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, ah!" exclaimed the other. "That's fine, indeed! It was about eighteen
      years ago that a project of that nature, worked out by the Academy of
      Medicine, and approved by it UNANIMOUSLY, was sent to the proper minister.
      We have not yet heard his reply."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You really believe," inquired Monsieur Loches, in some bewilderment, "you
      believe that there are some measures&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," broke in the doctor, "before we get though, you are going to
      suggest some measures yourself. Let me tell you what happened today. When
      I received your card I did not know that you were the father-in-law of
      George Dupont. I say that you were a deputy, and I thought that you wanted
      to get some information about these matters. There was a woman patient
      waiting to see me, and I kept her in my waiting-room&mdash;saying to
      myself, This is just the sort of person that our deputies ought to talk
      to."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor paused for a moment, then continued: "Be reassured, I will take
      care of your nerves. This patient has no trouble that is apparent to the
      eye. She is simply an illustration of the argument I have been advancing&mdash;that
      our worst enemy is ignorance. Ignorance&mdash;you understand me? Since I
      have got you here, sir, I am going to hold you until I have managed to
      cure a little of your ignorance! For I tell you, sir, it is a thing which
      drives me to distraction&mdash;we MUST do something about these
      conditions! Take this case, for example. Here is a woman who is very
      seriously infected. I told her&mdash;well, wait; you shall see for
      yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor went to the door and summoned into the room a woman whom
      Monsieur Loches had noticed waiting there. She was verging on old age,
      small, frail, and ill-nourished in appearance, poorly dressed, and yet
      with a suggestion of refinement about her. She stood near the door,
      twisting her hands together nervously, and shrinking from the gaze of the
      strange gentleman. The doctor began in an angry voice. "Did I not tell you
      to come and see me once every eight days? Is that not true?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman answered, in a faint voice, "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he exclaimed, "and how long has it been since you were here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three months, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three months! And you believe that I can take care of you under such
      conditions? I give you up! Do you understand? You discourage me, you
      discourage me." There was a pause. Then, seeing the woman's suffering, he
      began, in a gentler tone, "Come now, what is the reason that you have not
      come? Didn't you know that you have a serious disease&mdash;most serious?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, sir," replied the woman, "I know that very well&mdash;since my
      husband died of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor's voice bore once again its note of pity. "Your husband died of
      it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He took no care of himself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And was not that a warning to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doctor," the woman replied, "I would ask nothing better than to come as
      often as you told me, but the cost is too great."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How&mdash;what cost? You were coming to my free clinic."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir," replied the woman, "but that's during working hours, and then
      it is a long way from home. There are so many sick people, and I have to
      wait my turn, It is in the morning&mdash;sometimes I lose a whole day&mdash;and
      then my employer is annoyed, and he threatens to turn me off. It is things
      like that that keep people from coming, until they dare not put it off any
      longer. Then, too, sir&mdash;" the woman stopped, hesitating.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," demanded the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, nothing, sir," she stammered. "You have been too good to me already."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on," commanded the other. "Tell me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," murmured the woman, "I know I ought not to put on airs, but you
      see I have not always been so poor. Before my husband's misfortune, we
      were well fixed. So you see, I have a little pride. I have always managed
      to take care of myself. I am not a woman of the streets, and to stand
      around like that, with everybody else, to be obliged to tell all one's
      miseries out loud before the world! I am wrong, I know it perfectly well;
      I argue with myself&mdash;but all the same, it's hard, sir; I assure you,
      it is truly hard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor woman!" said the doctor; and for a while there was a silence. Then
      he asked: "It was your husband who brought you the disease?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir," was the reply. "Everything which happened to us came from him.
      We were living in the country when he got the disease. He went half crazy.
      He no longer knew how to manage his affairs. He gave orders here and there
      for considerable sums. We were not able to find the money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did he not undergo treatment?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He didn't know then. We were sold out, and we came to Paris. But we
      hadn't a penny. He decided to go to the hospital for treatment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, they looked him over, but they refused him any medicine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How was that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because we had been in Paris only three months. If one hasn't been a
      resident six months, one has no right to free medicine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that true?" broke in Monsieur Loches quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said the doctor, "that's the rule."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you see," said the woman, "it was not our fault."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You never had children?" inquired the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was never able to bring one to birth," was the answer. "My husband was
      taken just at the beginning of our marriage&mdash;it was while he was
      serving in the army. You know, sir&mdash;there are women about the
      garrisons&mdash;" She stopped, and there was a long silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come," said the doctor, "that's all right. I will arrange it with you.
      You can come here to my office, and you can come on Sunday mornings." And
      as the poor creature started to express her gratitude, he slipped a coin
      into her hand. "Come, come; take it," he said gruffly. "You are not going
      to play proud with me. No, no, I have no time to listen to you. Hush!" And
      he pushed her out of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he turned to the deputy. "You heard her story, sir," he said. "Her
      husband was serving his time in the army; it was you law-makers who
      compelled him to do that. And there are women about the garrisons&mdash;you
      heard how her voice trembled as she said that? Take my advice, sir, and
      look up the statistics as to the prevalence of this disease among our
      soldiers. Come to some of my clinics, and let me introduce you to other
      social types. You don't care very much about soldiers, perhaps&mdash;they
      belong to the lower classes, and you think of them as rough men. But let
      me show you what is going on among our college students&mdash;among the
      men our daughters are some day to marry. Let me show you the women who
      prey upon them! Perhaps, who knows&mdash;I can show you the very woman who
      was the cause of all the misery in your own family!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And as Monsieur Loches rose from his chair, the doctor came to him and
      took him by the hand. "Promise me, sir," he said, earnestly, "that you
      will come back and let me teach you more about these matters. It is a
      chance that I must not let go&mdash;the first time in my life that I ever
      got hold of a real live deputy! Come and make a study of this subject, and
      let us try to work out some sensible plan, and get seriously to work to
      remedy these frightful evils!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      George lived with his mother after Henriette had left his home. He was
      wretchedly unhappy and lonely. He could find no interest in any of the
      things which had pleased him before. He was ashamed to meet any of his
      friends, because he imagined that everyone must have heard the dreadful
      story&mdash;or because he was not equal to making up explanations for his
      mournful state. He no longer cared much about his work. What was the use
      of making a reputation or earning large fees when one had nothing to spend
      them for?
    </p>
    <p>
      All his thoughts were fixed upon the wife and child he had lost. He was
      reminded of Henriette in a thousand ways, and each way brought him a
      separate pang of grief. He had never realized how much he had come to
      depend upon her in every little thing&mdash;until now, when her
      companionship was withdrawn from him, and everything seemed to be a blank.
      He would come home at night, and opposite to him at the dinner-table would
      be his mother, silent and spectral. How different from the days when
      Henriette was there, radiant and merry, eager to be told everything that
      had happened to him through the day!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was also his worry about little Gervaise. He might no longer hear
      how she was doing, for he could not get up courage to ask his mother the
      news. Thus poor George was paying for his sins. He could make no
      complaints against the price, however high&mdash;only sometimes he
      wondered whether he would be able to pay it. There were times of such
      discouragement that he thought of different ways of killing himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      A curious adventure befell him during this period. He was walking one day
      in the park, when he saw approaching a girl whose face struck him as
      familiar. At first he could not recollect where he had seen her. It was
      only when she was nearly opposite him that he realized&mdash;it was the
      girl who had been the cause of all his misery!
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to look away, but he was too late. Her eyes had caught his, and
      she nodded and then stopped, exclaiming, "Why, how do you do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      George had to face her. "How do you do?" he responded, weakly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She held out her hand and he had to take it, but there was not much
      welcome in his clasp. "Where have you been keeping yourself?" she asked.
      Then, as he hesitated, she laughed good-naturedly, "What's the matter? You
      don't seem glad to see me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl&mdash;Therese was her name&mdash;had a little package under her
      arm, as if she had been shopping. She was not well dressed, as when George
      had met her before, and doubtless she thought that was the reason for his
      lack of cordiality. This made him rather ashamed, and so, only half
      realizing what he was doing, he began to stroll along with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did you never come to see me again?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      George hesitated. "I&mdash;I&mdash;" he stammered&mdash;"I've been married
      since then."
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed. "Oh! So that's it!" And then, as they came to a bench under
      some trees, "Won't you sit down a while?" There was allurement in her
      glance, but it made George shudder. It was incredible to him that he had
      ever been attracted by this crude girl. The spell was now broken
      completely.
    </p>
    <p>
      She quickly saw that something was wrong. "You don't seem very cheerful,"
      she said. "What's the matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And the man, staring at her, suddenly blurted out, "Don't you know what
      you did to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What I did to you?" Therese repeated wonderingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must know!" he insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then she tried to meet his gaze and could not. "Why&mdash;" she
      stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence between them. When George spoke again his voice was low
      and trembling. "You ruined my whole life," he said&mdash;"not only mine,
      but my family's. How could you do it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She strove to laugh it off. "A cheerful topic for an afternoon stroll!"
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long while George did not answer. Then, almost in a whisper, he
      repeated, "How could you do it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some one did it to me first," was the response. "A man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said George, "but he didn't know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can you tell whether he knew or not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You knew?" he inquired, wonderingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therese hesitated. "Yes, I knew," she said at last, defiantly. "I have
      known for years."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I'm not the only man."
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed. "I guess not!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There followed a long pause. At last he resumed, "I don't want to blame
      you; there's nothing to be gained by that; it's done, and can't be undone.
      But sometimes I wonder about it. I should like to understand&mdash;why did
      you do it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why? That's easy enough. I did it because I have to live."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You live that way?" he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why of course. What did you think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you were a&mdash;a&mdash;" He hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You thought I was respectable," laughed Therese. "Well, that's just a
      little game I was playing on you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I didn't give you any money!" he argued.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not that time," she said, "but I thought you would come back."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat gazing at her. "And you earn your living that way still?" he asked.
      "When you know what's the matter with you! When you know&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can I do? I have to live, don't I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But don't you even take care of yourself? Surely there must be some way,
      some place&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The reformatory, perhaps," she sneered. "No, thanks! I'll go there when
      the police catch me, not before. I know some girls that have tried that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But aren't you afraid?" cried the man. "And the things that will happen
      to you! Have you ever talked to a doctor&mdash;or read a book?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know," she said. "I've seen it all. If it comes to me, I'll go over the
      side of one of the bridges some dark night."
    </p>
    <p>
      George sat lost in thought. A strange adventure it seemed to him&mdash;to
      meet this girl under such different circumstances! It was as if he were
      watching a play from behind the scenes instead of in front. If only he had
      had this new view in time&mdash;how different would have been his life!
      And how terrible it was to think of the others who didn't know&mdash;the
      audience who were still sitting out in front, watching the spectacle,
      interested in it!
    </p>
    <p>
      His thoughts came back to Therese. He was curious about her and the life
      she lived. "Tell me a little about it," he said. "How you came to be doing
      this." And he added, "Don't think I want to preach; I'd really like to
      understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it's a common story," she said&mdash;"nothing especially romantic. I
      came to Paris when I was a girl. My parents had died, and I had no
      friends, and I didn't know what to do. I got a place as a nursemaid. I was
      seventeen years old then, and I didn't know anything. I believed what I
      was told, and I believed my employer. His wife was ill in a hospital, and
      he said he wanted to marry me when she died. Well, I liked him, and I was
      sorry for him&mdash;and then the first thing I knew I had a baby. And then
      the wife came back, and I was turned off. I had been a fool, of course. If
      I had been in her place should have done just what she did."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl was speaking in a cold, matter-of-fact voice, as of things about
      which she was no longer able to suffer. "So, there I was&mdash;on the
      street," she went on. "You have always had money, a comfortable home,
      education, friends to help you&mdash;all that. You can't imagine how it is
      to be in the world without any of these things. I lived on my savings as
      long as I could; then I had to leave my baby in a foundling's home, and I
      went out to do my five hours on the boulevards. You know the game, I have
      no doubt."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, George knew the game. Somehow or other he no longer felt bitter
      towards this poor creature. She was part of the system of which he was a
      victim also. There was nothing to be gained by hating each other. Just as
      the doctor said, what was needed was enlightenment. "Listen," he said,
      "why don't you try to get cured?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't got the price," was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he said, hesitatingly, "I know a doctor&mdash;one of the really
      good men. He has a free clinic, and I've no doubt he would take you in if
      I asked him to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "YOU ask him?" echoed the other, looking at George in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man felt somewhat uncomfortable. He was not used to playing the
      role of the good Samaritan. "I&mdash;I need not tell him about us," he
      stammered. "I could just say that I met you. I have had such a wretched
      time myself, I feel sorry for anybody that's in the same plight. I should
      like to help you if I could."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl sat staring before her, lost in thought. "I have treated you
      badly, I guess," she said. "I'm sorry. I'm ashamed of myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      George took a pencil and paper from his pocket and wrote the doctor's
      address. "Here it is," he said, in a business-like way, because he felt
      that otherwise he could become sentimental. He was half tempted to tell
      the woman what had happened to him, and all about Henriette and the sick
      child; but he realized that that would not do. So he rose and shook hands
      with her and left.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next time he saw the doctor he told him about this girl. He decided to
      tell him the truth&mdash;having already made so many mistakes trying to
      conceal things. The doctor agreed to treat the woman, making the condition
      that George promise not to see her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man was rather shocked at this. "Doctor," he exclaimed, "I
      assure you you are mistaken. The thing you have in mind would be utterly
      impossible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know," said the other, "you think so. But I think, young man, that I
      know more about life than you do. When a man and a woman have once
      committed such a sin, it is easy for them to slip back. The less time they
      spend talking about their misfortunes, and being generous and forbearing
      to each other, the better for them both."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Doctor," cried George. "I love Henriette! I could not possibly love
      anyone else. It would be horrible to me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said the doctor. "But you are not living with Henriette. You are
      wandering round, not knowing what to do with yourself next."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no need for anybody to tell George that. "What do you think?" he
      asked abruptly. "Is there any hope for me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think there is," said the other, who, in spite of his resolution, had
      become a sort of ambassador for the unhappy husband. He had to go to the
      Loches house to attend the child, and so he could not help seeing
      Henriette, and talking to her about the child's health and her own future.
      He considered that George had had his lesson, and urged upon the young
      wife that he would be wiser in future, and safe to trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      George had indeed learned much. He got new lessons every time he went to
      call at the physician's office&mdash;he could read them in the faces of
      the people he saw there. One day when he was alone in the waiting-room,
      the doctor came out of his inner office, talking to an elderly gentleman,
      whom George recognized as the father of one of his classmates at college.
      The father was a little shopkeeper, and the young man remembered how
      pathetically proud he had been of his son. Could it be, thought George,
      that this old man was a victim of syphilis?
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was the son, and not the father, who was the subject of the
      consultation. The old man was speaking in a deeply moved voice, and he
      stood so that George could not help hearing what he said. "Perhaps you
      can't understand," he said, "just what it means to us&mdash;the hopes we
      had of that boy! Such a fine fellow he was, and a good fellow, too, sir!
      We were so proud of him; we had bled our veins to keep him in college&mdash;and
      now just see!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't despair, sir," said the doctor, "we'll try to cure him." And he
      added with that same note of sorrow in his voice which George had heard,
      "Why did you wait so long before you brought the boy to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How was I to know what he had?" cried the other. "He didn't dare tell me,
      sir&mdash;he was afraid of my scolding him. And in the meantime the
      disease was running its course. When he realized that he had it, he went
      secretly to one of the quacks, who robbed him, and didn't cure him. You
      know how it is, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I know," said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such things ought not to be permitted," cried the old man. "What is our
      government about that it allows such things to go on? Take the conditions
      there at the college where my poor boy was ruined. At the very gates of
      the building these women are waiting for the lads! Ought they to be
      permitted to debauch young boys only fifteen years old? Haven't we got
      police enough to prevent a thing like that? Tell me, sir!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One would think so," said the doctor, patiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But is it that the police don't want to?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt they have the same excuse as all the rest&mdash;they don't know.
      Take courage, sir; we have cured worse cases than your son's. And some
      day, perhaps, we shall be able to change these conditions."
    </p>
    <p>
      So he went on with the man, leaving George with something to think about.
      How much he could have told them about what had happened to that young
      fellow when only fifteen years old! It had not been altogether the fault
      of the women who were lurking outside of the college gates; it was a fact
      that the boy's classmates had teased him and ridiculed him, had literally
      made his life a torment, until he had yielded to temptation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the old, old story of ignorant and unguided schoolboys all over the
      world! They thought that to be chaste was to be weak and foolish; that a
      fellow was not a man unless he led a life of debauchery like the rest. And
      what did they know about these dreadful diseases? They had the most
      horrible superstitions&mdash;ideas of cures so loathsome that they could
      not be set down in print; ideas as ignorant and destructive as those of
      savages in the heart of Africa. And you might hear them laughing and
      jesting about one another's condition. They might be afflicted with
      diseases which would have the most terrible after-effects upon their whole
      lives and upon their families&mdash;diseases which cause tens of thousands
      of surgical operations upon women, and a large percentage of blindness and
      idiocy in children&mdash;and you might hear them confidently express the
      opinion that these diseases were no worse than a bad cold!
    </p>
    <p>
      And all this mass of misery and ignorance covered over and clamped down by
      a taboo of silence, imposed by the horrible superstition of sex-prudery!
      George went out from the doctor's office trembling with excitement over
      this situation. Oh, why had not some one warned him in time? Why didn't
      the doctors and the teachers lift up their voices and tell young men about
      these frightful dangers? He wanted to go out in the highways and preach it
      himself&mdash;except that he dared not, because he could not explain to
      the world his own sudden interest in this forbidden topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      These was only one person he dared to talk to: that was his mother&mdash;to
      whom he ought to have talked many, many years before. He was moved to
      mention to her the interview he had overheard in the doctor's office. In a
      sudden burst of grief he told her of his struggles and temptations; he
      pleaded with her to go to Henriette once more&mdash;to tell her these
      things, and try to make her realize that he alone was not to blame for
      them, that they were a condition which prevailed everywhere, that the only
      difference between her husband and other men was that he had had the
      misfortune to be caught.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was pressure being applied to Henriette from several sides. After
      all, what could she do? She was comfortable in her father's home, so far
      as the physical side of things went; but she knew that all her friends
      were gossiping and speculating about her separation from her husband, and
      sooner or later she would have to make up her mind, either to separate
      permanently from George or to return to him. There was not much happiness
      for her in the thought of getting a divorce from a man whom deep in her
      heart she loved. She would be practically a widow the rest of her life,
      and the home in which poor little Gervaise would be brought up would not
      be a cheerful one.
    </p>
    <p>
      George was ready to offer any terms, if only she would come back to his
      home. They might live separate lives for as long as Henriette wished. They
      would have no more children until the doctor declared it was quite safe;
      and in the meantime he would be humble and patient, and would try his best
      to atone for the wrong that he had done her.
    </p>
    <p>
      To these arguments Madame Dupont added others of her own. She told the
      girl some things which through bitter experience she had learned about the
      nature and habits of men; things that should be told to every girl before
      marriage, but which almost all of them are left to find out afterwards,
      with terrible suffering and disillusionment. Whatever George's sins may
      have been, he was a man who had been chastened by suffering, and would
      know how to value a woman's love for the rest of his life. Not all men
      knew that&mdash;not even those who had been fortunate in escaping from the
      so-called "shameful disease."
    </p>
    <p>
      Henriette was also hearing arguments from her father, who by this time had
      had time to think things over, and had come to the conclusion that the
      doctor was right. He had noted his son-in-law's patience and penitence,
      and had also made sure that in spite of everything Henriette still loved
      him. The baby apparently was doing well; and the Frenchman, with his
      strong sense of family ties, felt it a serious matter to separate a child
      permanently from its father. So in the end he cast the weight of his
      influence in favor of a reconciliation, and Henriette returned to her
      husband, upon terms which the doctor laid down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor played in these negotiations the part which he had not been
      allowed to play in the marriage. For the deputy was now thoroughly awake
      to the importance of the duty he owed his daughter. In fact, he had become
      somewhat of a "crank" upon the whole subject. He had attended several of
      the doctor's clinics, and had read books and pamphlets on the subject of
      syphilis, and was now determined that there should be some practical steps
      towards reform.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the outset, he had taken the attitude of the average legislator, that
      the thing to do was to strengthen the laws against prostitution, and to
      enforce them more strictly. He echoed the cry of the old man whom George
      had heard in the doctor's office: "Are there not enough police?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must go to the source," he declared. "We must proceed against these
      miserable women&mdash;veritable poisoners that they are!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He really thought this was going to the source! But the doctor was quick
      to answer his arguments. "Poisoners?" he said. "You forget that they have
      first been poisoned. Every one of these women who communicates the disease
      has first received it from some man."
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Loches advanced to his second idea, to punish the men. But the
      doctor had little interest in this idea either. He had seen it tried so
      many times&mdash;such a law could never be enforced. What must come first
      was education, and by this means a modification of morals. People must
      cease to treat syphilis as a mysterious evil, of which not even the name
      could be pronounced.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," objected the other, "one cannot lay it bare to children in our
      educational institutions!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?" asked the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because, sir, there are curiosities which it would be imprudent to
      awaken."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor became much excited whenever he heard this argument. "You
      believe that you are preventing these curiosities from awakening?" he
      demanded. "I appeal to those&mdash;both men and women&mdash;who have
      passed through colleges and boarding schools! Such curiosities cannot be
      smothered, and they satisfy themselves as best they can, basely, vilely. I
      tell you, sir, there is nothing immoral about the act which perpetuates
      life by means of love. But we organize around it, so far as concerns our
      children, a gigantic and rigorous conspiracy of silence. The worthy
      citizen takes his daughter and his son to popular musical comedies, where
      they listen to things which would make a monkey blush; but it is forbidden
      to discuss seriously before the young that act of love which people seem
      to think they should only know of through blasphemies and profanations!
      Either that act is a thing of which people can speak without blushing&mdash;or
      else, sir, it is a matter for the innuendoes of the cabaret and the
      witticisms of the messroom! Pornography is admitted, but science is not! I
      tell you, sir, that is the thing which must be changed! We must elevate
      the soul of the young man by taking these facts out of the realm of
      mystery and of slang. We must awaken in him a pride in that creative power
      with which each one of us is endowed. We must make him understand that he
      is a sort of temple in which is prepared the future of the race, and we
      must teach him that he must transmit, intact, the heritage entrusted to
      him&mdash;the precious heritage which has been built out of the tears and
      miseries and sufferings of an interminable line of ancestors!"
    </p>
    <p>
      So the doctor argued. He brought forth case after case to prove that the
      prostitute was what she was, not because of innate vileness, but because
      of economic conditions. It happened that the deputy came to one of the
      clinics where he met Therese. The doctor brought her into his consulting
      room, after telling her that the imposing-looking gentleman was a friend
      of the director of the opera, and might be able to recommend her for a
      position on the stage to which she aspired. "Tell him all about yourself,"
      he said, "how you live, and what you do, and what you would like to do.
      You will get him interested in you."
    </p>
    <p>
      So the poor girl retold the story of her life. She spoke in a
      matter-of-fact voice, and when she came to tell how she had been obliged
      to leave her baby in the foundling asylum, she was surprised that Monsieur
      Loches showed horror. "What could I do?" she demanded. "How could I have
      taken care of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Didn't you ever miss it?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I missed it. But what difference did that make? It would have
      died of hunger with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still," he said, "it was your child&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was the father's child, too, wasn't it? Much attention he paid to it!
      If I had been sure of getting money enough, I would have put it out to
      nurse. But with the twenty-five or thirty francs a month I could have
      earned as a servant, could I have paid for a baby? That's the situation a
      girl faces&mdash;so long as I wanted to remain honest, it was impossible
      for me to keep my child. You answer, perhaps, 'You didn't stay honest
      anyway.' That's true. But then&mdash;when you are hungry, and a nice young
      fellow offers you dinner, you'd have to be made of wood to refuse him. Of
      course, if I had had a trade&mdash;but I didn't have any. So I went on the
      street&mdash;You know how it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell us about it," said the doctor. "This gentleman is from the country."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that so?" said the girl. "I never supposed there was anyone who didn't
      know about such things. Well, I took the part of a little working-girl. A
      very simple dress&mdash;things I had made especially for that&mdash;a
      little bundle in a black napkin carried in my hand&mdash;so I walked along
      where the shops are. It's tiresome, because to do it right, you have to
      patter along fast. Then I stop before a shop, and nine times out of ten,
      there you are! A funny thing is that the men&mdash;you'd imagine they had
      agreed on the words to approach you with. They have only two phrases; they
      never vary them. It's either, 'You are going fast, little one.' Or it's,
      'Aren't you afraid all alone?' One thing or the other. One knows pretty
      well what they mean. Isn't it so?" The girl paused, then went on. "Again,
      I would get myself up as a young widow. There, too, one has to walk fast:
      I don't know why that should be so, but it is. After a minute or two of
      conversation, they generally find out that I am not a young widow, but
      that doesn't make any difference&mdash;they go on just the same."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who are the men?" asked the deputy. "Clerks? Traveling salesmen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not much," she responded. "I keep a lookout for gentlemen&mdash;like
      yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They SAY they are gentlemen," he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sometimes I can see it," was the response. "Sometimes they wear orders.
      It's funny&mdash;if they have on a ribbon when you first notice them, they
      follow you, and presto&mdash;the ribbon is gone! I always laugh over that.
      I've watched them in the glass of the shop windows. They try to look
      unconcerned, but as they walk along they snap out the ribbon with their
      thumb&mdash;as one shells little peas, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused; then, as no one joined in her laugh, she continued, "Well, at
      last the police got after me, That's a story that I've never been able to
      understand. Those filthy men gave me a nasty disease, and then I was to be
      shut in prison for it! That was a little too much, it seems to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said the doctor, grimly, "you revenged yourself on them&mdash;from
      what you have told me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The other laughed. "Oh, yes," she said. "I had my innings." She turned to
      Monsieur Loches. "You want me to tell you that? Well, just on the very day
      I learned that the police were after me, I was coming home furious,
      naturally. It was on the Boulevard St. Denis, if you know the place&mdash;and
      whom do you think I met? My old master&mdash;the one who got me into
      trouble, you know. There it was, God's own will! I said to myself, 'Now,
      my good fellow, here's the time where you pay me what you owe me, and with
      interest, too!' I put on a little smile&mdash;oh, it didn't take very
      long, you may be sure!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman paused; her face darkened, and she went on, in a voice trembling
      with agitation: "When I had left him, I was seized with a rage. A sort of
      madness got into my blood. I took on all the men who offered themselves,
      for whatever they offered me, for nothing, if they didn't offer me
      anything. I took as many as I could, the youngest ones and the handsomest
      ones. Just so! I only gave them back what they had given to me. And since
      that time I haven't really cared about anyone any more. I just turned it
      all into a joke." She paused, and then looking at the deputy, and reading
      in his face the horror with which he was regarding her, "Oh, I am not the
      only one!" she exclaimed. "There are lots of other women who do the same.
      To be sure, it is not for vengeance&mdash;it is because they must have
      something to eat. For even if you have syphilis, you have to eat, don't
      you? Eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She had turned to the doctor, but he did not answer. There was a long
      silence; and then thinking that his friend, the deputy, had heard enough
      for one session, the doctor rose. He dismissed the woman, the cause of all
      George Dupont's misfortunes, and turning to Monsieur Loches, said: "It was
      on purpose that I brought that wretched prostitute before you. In her the
      whole story is summed up&mdash;not merely the story of your son-in-law,
      but that of all the victims of the red plague. That woman herself is a
      victim, and she is a symbol of the evil which we have created and which
      falls upon our own heads again. I could add nothing to her story, I only
      ask you, Monsieur Loches&mdash;when next you are proposing new laws in the
      Chamber of Deputies, not to forget the horrors which that poor woman has
      exposed to you!"

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
